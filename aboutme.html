  <h1 class="title">About me</h1>
      <p>Who am I? Online I am known as Sinclair-Speccy, a combination of the ZX Spectrum and the popular nickname for the ZX Spectrum. People also use Speccy, Sinclair  and Alphonse online for me.</p>
		
	  <p>If we drift away from the internet my name is Tasha. My last name, country and other personal information aren't important to post here.</p>
		
	  <p>I have a penchant for vintage technology like mainframes (IBM 704, CDC 6500, Whirlwind I, etc) and microcomputers (Mark-8, MK14, etc). In terms of hardware and setup I own, my main computer is a Windows 10 Lenovo machine. Not the most powerful machine but it gets the job done.</p>

<h3>"I noticed you have a personal projects page which has blunt information, can you explain them?"</h3>
		
<p>You can look at some of my personal projects <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/projects.html" title="Personal projects">here</a> but as a better overun of each one:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
          <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/GOTS.html" title="GOTS">Guardians of the School</a>: Perhaps a bit of a generic name for this project. This one started as a vent piece from when I started high school. It features a young teenage girl by the name of Yuriko Larson who attends Timber Creek High School as a year 7 student. Things at her school begin to get a bit bizarre with rumours of people who are "Guardians of the School", ghosts of students who can never leave until they graduate, manipulation, broken promises and a man who is out to change her life for the bad, or is it for the good? This one is based a lot on my personal experiences in person.
</li>
		
        <li>
          <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/TGB.html" title="TBG">Time Goes By</a>: More of a space-themed thing inspired by a flash game I play. It is about a boy who goes by the name Quiv who goes on a journey in space to change the future for the greater good after humans fucked with the Earth too much, forcing everyone into out of space.
        </li>
		
        <li>
          <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/WD.html" title="WD">Warrior Dragons</a>: The first of my projects I started when I was younger. Has mostly been sitting in the dust as I grew out of it. It is a story about a young girl and her male friend who go out on an adventure in the land of Valmore to figure out the reason for the elements (fire, earth, wind, water, etc) going corrupt and causing havoc. It was mainly focused around dragons in the original version, but the new version attenpts to drift away from this.
        </li>
		
      <li>
		  <a href="https://os-tans.moe/forum/" title="OS-tan.moe">OS-tan.moe</a>: A more recent project that I have slowly put together with the help of some friends online. It's an OS-tan project that focuses on more of the fanon side of stuff while not being restricted by a canon.

      <p>This site was originally just going to be a place for me to share the files I have on my external hard drive which has 757GB of stuff that are mostly iso files I have collected from various sources over the past few years but it turns out I can't do that. However, from experimenting a lot with vintage Linux distros in my spare time I decided this site should have more than my files (that can't even be uploaded yet as this site isn't self-hosted) so I thought let's make guides at first, then a friend agreed with the idea of making reviews so here we are now. Technology will always have a place in my heart, especially vintage technology even if I wasn't born in the time they came out. You can look at some of my personal projects <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/projects.html" title="Personal projects">here</a>.</p>
	
      <p>The design of this site began as some simple HTML code since I was new to it again despite learning it in 2018 and the redesign started in June 2022 to make the guides and reviews look neat and tidy.</p>
