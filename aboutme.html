      <h1 class="title">About me</h1>
      <p>Who am I? Online I am known as Sinclair-Speccy, a combination of the ZX Spectrum and the popular nickname for the ZX Spectrum. We drift away from the internet my name is Tasha and my last name, country and other personal information aren't important to post here. I have a penchant for vintage technology like mainframes (IBM 704, CDC 6500, Whirlwind I, etc) and microcomputers (Mark-8, MK14, etc). I like vaporwave, synthwave, phonk, experimental music and the arists to go along with these music tastes are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCexygOZm9iV4oXTH3On6PCA" target="_blank">Frums</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPVnLrkvF3M_H1NTOsMvgrA" target="_blank">Carpenter Brut</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUv2Q_X1VNxF_9elEGi05rQ" target="_blank">Windows96</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFyDhQ3yNr8eYl895l7nYJw" target="_blank">KSLV Noh</a>. I enjoy spicy chips and noodles too lol.</p>
      <p>This site was originally just going to be a place for me to share the files I have on my external hard drive which has 757GB of stuff that are mostly iso files I have collected from various sources over the past few years but it turns out I can't do that. However, from experimenting a lot with vintage Linux distros in my spare time I decided this site should have more than my files that can't even be uploaded yet as this site isn't self-hosted so I thought let's make guides at first, then a friend agreed with the idea of making reviews so here we are now. Technology will always have a place in my heart, especially vintage technology even if I wasn't born in the time they came out. You can look at some of my personal projects <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/projects.html" title="Personal projects">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The design of this site began as some simple HTML code since I was new to it again despite learning it in 2018 and the redesign started in June 2022 to make the guides and reviews look neat and tidy.</p>
