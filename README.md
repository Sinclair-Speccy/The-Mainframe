# The Mainframe

This repository contains the source code for my personal website: [The Mainframe](https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/).  
Feel free to browse the code to see how different pages and effects are implemented, such as the CRT effect on the "About Me" page (which uses modified code). Other content and updates may be added here from time to time.

## Contact & Takedown Requests

If you need something removed from the site that you own, please **email me** using the address listed on the "About Me" page of the site.  
Only use the GitHub Issues section if you do not have access to email.

When making a takedown request, please provide reasonable evidence to support your claim.  
For content linked via the Wayback Machine, please note that I likely will not remove itâ€”such requests are better directed to the Internet Archive.

## License
