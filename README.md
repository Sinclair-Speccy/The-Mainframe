# The-Mainframe

Source code for my website. This can be used to view how certain pages were created that you like, and might want to replicate, such as the CRT effect on the "About Me" page which uses modified code. Other content may be added here from time to time.

## Takedown Requests and Other Information

If you want me to take down something on the site that you own, I kindly ask that you **PLEASE** send me an email to the address listed on the "About Me" page on my site. Only use the issues section if you don’t have an email.

Please provide reasonable evidence to support your request. Regarding content linked via the Wayback Machine, I most likely won’t remove it, as it would make more sense to complain to the Wayback Machine instead of to me.
