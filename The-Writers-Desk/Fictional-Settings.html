      <p>Links to fictional settings I have made. They each have their own dedicated section.</p>
		<ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/The-Writers-Desk/Settings/GOTS/GOTS.html" title="GOTS">Guardians of the School</a>: Perhaps a bit of a generic name for this project. A lot more info can be found on the section it has for itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/The-Writers-Desk/Settings/TGB/index.html" title="TBG">Time Goes By</a>: More of a space themed thing inspired by a flash game I play. Although there is one page only, I may make two to explain the lore and another one acting like a website from the universe the setting is set in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://terminationofdusk.miraheze.org/" title="Termination of Dusk">Termination of Dusk</a>: Originally known as "Warrior Dragons", it is one of the first of my projects I started when I was younger. Has mostly been sitting in the dust as I grew out of it. Years later I sorta picked up on it again and Termination of Dusk hasits own wiki hosted on Miraheze.
        </li>
		   <li>
		  <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/personalprojects/OS-TAN-FANON/Index.html" title="The Mainframe - An OS-tan Fanon">The Mainframe - An OS-tan Fanon</a>: My OS-tan fanon that used to be hosted on OS-tans.moe that was then moved over to be hosted on my site for more flexibility. It is a fanon that aims to be free of glurge while including more male characters and redundant OSes/computers. Shares the same name as the main site :P.
