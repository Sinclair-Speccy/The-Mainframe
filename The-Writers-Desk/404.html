        A person who thinks all the time<br>
        Has nothing to think about except thoughts<br>
        So, he loses touch with reality<br>
        And lives in a world of illusions
      </p>

      <p>
        By thoughts, I mean specifically, chatter in the skull<br>
        Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words<br>
        Of reckoning and calculating<br>
        I'm not saying that thinking is bad<br>
        Like everything else, It's useful in moderation<br>
        A good servant, but a bad master
      </p>

      <p>
        And all so-called civilized peoples<br>
        Have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive<br>
        Because, through excessive thinking<br>
        They have lost touch with reality<br>
        That's to say<br>
        We confuse signs<br>
        With the real world
