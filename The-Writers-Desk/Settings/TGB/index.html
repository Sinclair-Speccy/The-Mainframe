              <p>This is currently the main index page for this
              setting... I plan on making seperate sections for
              this setting, like business sites and all.</p>
              <p>As an overview, Time Goes By was made in 2017,
              inspired by a game called Plazma Burst 2. The story
              focues around a boy named Quiv who was known as a
              "Earthlander" as he stayed behind on Earth when
              everyone fled to Mars. One day he accidently
              activates a old spaceship that was claimed to no
              longer be in use, only to have the ship fly off in
              space. he gets stuck with another person who had that
              spaceship as their home.</p>
              <p>The main focus of the story was about what could
              happen in the future if we didn't look after the
              planet but well, seems like some of the stuff from
              the story is already happening...</p>
              <p>On the right side are naviagtion buttons to go to
              each section. This page only serves as a page to take
              you to other sites for now. Might add lore and all
              later?</p>

        <p>"In the tapestry of existence, as the hands of time
        gently weave their intricate threads, we find ourselves at
        a crucial juncture, where the fragility of Earth's embrace
        and the vastness of space converge.</p>
        <p>For as time goes by, like the ephemeral petals adrift
        upon a fading breeze, we witness the haunting realization
        that our beloved home is beset by the consequences of our
        own making. Yet, amidst the depths of this dire lament, we
        find solace in the celestial expanse above, where the
        twinkling stars beckon with their timeless wisdom.</p>
        <p>Let us not be blind to the legacy we leave behind, for
        Earth, our cradle of life, yearns for our nurturing touch.
        As each passing moment etches its mark upon the tapestry of
        time, let us rise as stewards of this fragile planet,
        cherishing its delicate ecosystems and safeguarding the
        pristine wonders that remain.</p>
        <p>Let us recognize that our actions ripple through the
        cosmos, shaping the destiny of not only Earth but also the
        countless worlds that beckon from afar.</p>
        <p>In this cosmic ballet, where the eons unfurl like
        celestial choreography, may we awaken to the delicate
        interplay between Earth and the vast expanse of space. For
        as the stars twinkle in their eternal dance, they remind us
        of our interconnectedness, inspiring us to protect, to
        heal, and to cultivate a future where harmony between
        humanity and its celestial abode reigns supreme.</p>
        <p>With every breath, with every choice, let us remember
        that time goes by, yet the power to shape our shared
        destiny lies within our hands. Together, Quiv, let us
        embark on a journey of reverence, rediscovering the
        profound beauty of Earth and forging a legacy that echoes
        throughout the cosmos."</p>
