          <p>This is currently the only page for this setting... as per what the main section said. I plan on remaking
            this as a fictional website for one of the cooperations in Time Goes By.</p>
          <p>As an overview, Time Goes By was made in 2017, insoired by a game called Plazma Burst 2. The story focues
            around a boy named Quiv who was known as a "Earthlander" as he stayed behind on Earth when everyone fled to
            Mars. One day he accidently activates a old spaceship that was claimed to no longer be in use, only to have
            the ship fly off in space. he gets stuck with another person who had that spaceship as their home. </p>
          <p>The main focus of the story was about what could happen in the future if we didn't look after the planet
            but well, seems like some of the stuff from the story is already happening...</p>

          <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do:
            once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations
            in it, <i>`and what is the use of a book,’</i> thought Alice <i>`without pictures or conversation?’</i></p>
          <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and
            stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking
            the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
          <p>There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear
            the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it
            occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but
            when the Rabbit actually <b>TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT- POCKET</b>, and looked at it, and then
            hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a
            rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran
            across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
            hedge.</p>
          <p>In another moment down went Alice after it, <a href="/misc/tallsidetext.html">never once considering how in
              the world she was to get out again.</a></p>
