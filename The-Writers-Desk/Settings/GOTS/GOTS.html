                    <p>At the top you can navigate across sections such as the characters, lore, setting, etc...</p>
                    <p>I am not sure on what else to mention but have fun looking around!</p>
					<p>As of now, progress on thia section will be slow since I am curently combatting school work and real life ^^;;</p>

            /* this seems like a lot for just one font and I would have to agree 
    but I wanted to include an example of how to include a custom font.
    If you download a font file you can upload it onto your Neocities
    and then link it! Many fonts have separate files for each style
    (bold, italic, etc. T_T) which is why there are so many!
