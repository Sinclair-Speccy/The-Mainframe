                <h1>Relationships</h1>
                <p>Karasu's connections are both profound and scarce.

One of his remarkable talents is the power to transform into a raven, a symbol that reflects his name's origin, meaning "raven" in Japanese. This transformative skill enables him to navigate realms beyond the ordinary and unlock hidden truths.</p>
