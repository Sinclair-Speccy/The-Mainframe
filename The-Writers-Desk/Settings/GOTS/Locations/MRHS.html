                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>During the early 1900s, within the confines of Meadows Ridge, an educational landscape existed where students were bound to attend state primary school until reaching the age of 14. However, a notable absence prevailed for those yearning to prolong their scholastic journey until they were 17 and eligible for entry into a technical college. This academic void sparked the inception of a "Continuation School" in 1909, a proactive step to bridge the educational disparity.</p>
				
				<p>Inaugurated on the 8th of February in 1910, the Continuation School embarked on its journey with a modest cohort of 79 students, overseen by eight educators and an interim headmaster. Housed within two forsaken rooms of a disused structure, the school's humble beginnings paved the way for its eventual evolution. The appointment of Charles William Gray as headmaster in April 1910 heralded a phase of growth. Within a single year, the student body expanded to comprise 150 eager minds, prompting the expansion of facilities to encompass 12 rooms. As the curtains of 1911 drew back, the institution was christened "Meadows Ridge High School," a monumental step that established it as the pioneering public secondary school in the town.</p>	<br>
