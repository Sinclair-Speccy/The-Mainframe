						<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early 1900s, students aged 6 to 14 were required to go to statep primary schools. There was nowhere for those who couldn't afford private tuition to continue their study until they were 17 and could enter a technical college. In 1909, community concern increased for this gap to be addressed, resulting in the construction of a "Continuation School" and provide an academic education for beginning teachers as well as a general education for anyone desiring to advance their education. On February 8, 1910, 79 pupils, eight teachers, and an acting headmaster began courses in two abandoned rooms of a building that was no longer used. In April 1910, Charles William Gray was elected headmaster. Twelve months later, enrolment had climbed to 150, and the building had 12 rooms. The school was renamed Meadows Ridge High School and thus became Meadows Ridge's first state secondary school.</p>

            /* this seems like a lot for just one font and I would have to agree 
    but I wanted to include an example of how to include a custom font.
    If you download a font file you can upload it onto your Neocities
    and then link it! Many fonts have separate files for each style
    (bold, italic, etc. T_T) which is why there are so many!
