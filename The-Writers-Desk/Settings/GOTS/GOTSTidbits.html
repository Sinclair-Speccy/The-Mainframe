          <p>Below you can find some writing that is related to
          GOTS. I tend to write this stuff out of boredom as I do
          not have the energy to write a fullout story. The
          prdering may be a bit weird but first it goes by
          <i>years</i>. Each year has its own title along with the
          year. Below each year are <i>chapters</i> that have their
          own chapter title. Below each chapter are random bits of
          writing that would most likely fit in the chapter.</p>
