        <h1>1.2 – A Community Effort</h1>
        <p>Artists draw based on community input, craftsmen create
        collages and ongoing iterations refine these characters
        further. Over time this collaborative process has led to
        the creation of major versions of OS girls while preserving
        a myriad of minor variations in memory. Ultimately, the
        growth and evolution of OS-tans is a truly communal effort.
        By understanding this background it becomes clear that
        OS-tans meant a lot to the residents of Nijiura.</p>
        <p>While mostly unknown to outsiders there have been a few
        “wikis” from Japan and most likely Nijiura. One of the
        earliest may be the OS summary site with its first archive
        going back to September 12th, 2004 meaning it would be 1
        year, 1 month, and 6 days after Me-tan was first made. This
        site not only uses the term “OS Musume” but also explains
        their origins and provides summaries of the main
        characters.</p>
        <p>The origins listed on this site match up with what I
        have researched. Characters were drawn by several different
        artists and gradually became established. In that sense,
        the “original author” can be considered to be everyone who
        contributed ideas on the anonymous boards. However, because
        it is inherently difficult for an individual on such forums
        to assert copyright, Me-aki and XP-aki stepped forward
        individually, meaning they legally hold the copyrights to
        their respective creations.</p>
        <p>But if Me and XP had only been published on personal
        websites, would they have spread across the internet as
        widely as they did? Probably not. In other words, “OS-tan”
        was born thanks to the image board known as 2ch and its
        active users.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OS Musume Original Author:</strong>
          Toshiaki</li>
          <li><strong>Copyright Holders for the
          Characters:</strong> Those who first drew them (Me-aki,
          XP-aki, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Copyright for Each Derivative Work:</strong>
          The respective creators</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since these events took place on an anonymous forum and
        involved anthropomorphising Microsoft’s operating systems,
        the legal aspects are somewhat unclear and complicated.</p>
        <p>Artwork was posted, personalities were assigned, further
        design refinements were made, and many users contributed
        various elements that gradually shaped the character. Many
        “Toshiakis” drew OS-tan; some created manga, some wrote
        stories, and some made Flash animations or games. In this
        way, the world of OS-tan expanded within the community.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that during this period of OS
        anthropomorphism, 2channel (2ch) was not directly involved.
        The idea of anthropomorphism had existed long before (think
        of characters like Magical Tokochan), so arguing over who
        originally conceived the concept of OS anthropomorphism is
        futile, the only potential disputes would concern specific
        design aspects. The site also links to +Nijiura+, another
        board like Futaba Channel that I will get to later.</p>
        <p>The next wiki would be the “Nijiura Character
        Dictionary.” This wiki is linked on Futaba-info, a site
        that “supports Futaba without permission” and “mainly
        conveys various information about Futaba Channel.” While
        simple, it shows some characters like XP-tan, ME-tan, and
        mentions “OS Son” for the first time.</p>
        <p>The last of these wikis is “Futaba ★ Rainbow
        Board@Wiki”. It describes itself as a “project support site
        where we all come together to collect characters and
        movements from the Futaba Nijiura Board.” The earliest
        archive for the OS section is October 26, 2006.</p>
        <p>Unlike the previous two, this wiki gets into detailed
        information about each OS-tan, explaining the history
        behind each character, like 98-tan’s "Hacchan" nickname and
        Me-tan’s love of leeks and roll cakes. It also explains
        that Sonata-sensei gave herself the title "Sensei" rather
        than it being assigned by others.</p>
        <p>In 2004, a separate Japanese imageboard called +Nijiura+
        embraced the OS-tan phenomenon much like Futaba Channel.
        However, it’s important not to confuse this site with the
        Nijiura board on Futaba, as they are two different
        places.</p>
        <p>+Nijiura+ created individual characters for each new
        release of Mac OS X, inspired by their codenames: Cheetah,
        Puma, Jaguar, Panther, Tiger, and Leopard. Most of what
        follows is drawn from older forum posts on OS-tan
        Collections.</p>
