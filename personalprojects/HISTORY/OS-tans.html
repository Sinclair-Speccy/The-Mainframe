        <h1>1 - OS-tans, their origins and the Nijiura community at
        Futaba</h1>
        <p>When you think of OS-tans you likely picture the “main
        cast” such as XP-tan, 95-tan, Me-tan, 2K-tan and so. Most
        fans simply admire these characters but after spending time
        in several OS-tan (or related) communities, I noticed
        common issues in how OS-tan information is presented, how
        research is conducted and even in the way their backstories
        are explained. These shortcomings motivated me to write
        this piece. Before I delve into those criticisms though
        it’s important to explain where OS-tans came from. While
        researching unrelated OS-tan topics, I found a blog that
        discussed some of these issues, many of my thoughts below
        are based on that blog, as well as my own experiences.
        (You’ll find a link to it at the end.)</p>
        <p>So, what exactly are OS-tans? Technically, it is more
        accurately to call them “OS-musume” now (a point I’ll
        explain later) but they are best known moe personifications
        of operating systems that are primarily Windows,
        originating from Futaba’s Nijiura image board. While the
        term “OS-tan” is popular among English speakers, within the
        Futaba community the characters are usually called
        OS-musume. Although the concept of moe personification is
        not new, OS-tans have a particularly interesting origin
        story.</p>
        <p>Nijiura, one of the boards on Futaba Channel, is known
        for its chaotic atmosphere and an unspoken rule regarding
        image usage. Members recognise that images posted there can
        be freely referenced, modified or incorporated into new
        stories. This collaborative spirit often leads to images
        being edited such as line drawings being coloured or
        refined in unexpected ways, which can transform simple
        sketches or collages into stories. This is why you might
        see many different versions of an OS-tan drawing (for
        instance, various Windows 95 wallpapers which can be seen
        on the old image vault).</p>
        <p>Criticism of such modifications is rare; the community
        generally rejects changes that detract from the overall
        enjoyment. It’s this chaotic yet creative process that gave
        birth to OS-tans on Futaba’s Nijiura board. Alongside the
        initial creators, many individuals, often referred to
        collectively as “Toshiaki”, emerged as artists and
        craftsmen who produced collages, gifs, and more. Some were
        anonymous, others were doujinshi or commercial artists and
        some worked exclusively on Futaba. In this way, OS-tans
        were not created by a single individual but rather by a
        loosely organised collective effort.</p>
        <p>A guiding principle in the community is “Enjoyable and
        Exciting” (E&amp;E). Even a simple image, an original
        drawing, or a seemingly trivial comment can spark
        unexpected discussions and lead to the creation of new
        ideas. Many well-known topics within the community likely
        started as spontaneous posts that evolved into significant
        discussions which how OS-tans actually came to be. In the
        OS-tan fan book it says that Me-tan was made on August 6,
        2003 when an image of the System Properties for Windows Me
        was posted alongside the comment “But Windows Me is cute
        even though it's no good.” This remark emphasised Windows
        Me’s endearing quality: cute yet clumsy, and lovable
        despite its flaws. Toshiaki and others agreed with this
        sentiment and by around 7 AM two “Me personifications” were
        quickly improvised, marking the start of the larger “Futaba
        OS Personification” movement. On Futaba Channel, any
        interesting material or idea whether from a chat, a reply,
        or an image is quickly transformed into collages, drawings,
        or joke replies. This spontaneous collaboration has led to
        significant trends, often referred to as “festivals.”</p>
