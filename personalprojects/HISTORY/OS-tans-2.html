<h1>1.1 – Evolution and Collaboration</h1>

<p>While there are many sites that go over each OS-tan I didn't initially intend to myself, but I may as well go through them in order:</p>

<p>First was <strong>Me-tan</strong>. According to the <em>Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book</em>, on August 6, 2003, when an image of the System Properties for Windows Me was posted, someone commented, "But Windows Me is cute even though it's no good." This highlighted Windows Me's human-like qualities—cute yet clumsy, lovable despite its flaws. It was suggested that Windows Me wasn’t just an inorganic entity but had a human touch to it.</p>

<p>Toshiaki and others present agreed with this opinion. Around 7 AM, two "Me personifications" were quickly improvised, marking the beginning of the larger "Futaba OS Personification" movement. The first was a young girl with short hair, a shy or nervous expression, wide, round eyes, blush marks on her cheeks, and small fists held close to her chest. She wore a long-sleeved top, and the word "Me" was written on her forehead with the Windows Me logo. The second was a young girl with short red hair, glasses, and a distinct pointed strand sticking up from her head. She had red eyes, clasped hands in front of her, and wore a white bikini with blue trim and ties, with the word "Me" on the bikini.</p>

<p>Two hours after the first image was posted, at around 9 AM on August 6, 2003, a pivotal illustration appeared that would shape the future of anthropomorphised OS designs. This design featured green braided hair, stray hair strand and a warning mark on a red bow. By later in the morning an apron dress with further refinements was added and this basic design of Me remains almost unchanged today.</p>

<p>The <em>Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book</em> mentions that the idea for a <strong>2K personification</strong> emerged the same day Me-tan was created, around 10 AM. The first design featured a young girl with long hair, spiky strands sticking out, a confident expression and large expressive eyes. She wore a hoodie with "2000" written on it and was holding an open book. This original design bore little resemblance to the final 2K-tan we know today.</p>

<p>The <em>Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book</em> also explains that <strong>Homeko's design</strong> was based on an early XP design from 2003 when the first designs for Me-tan and 2K-tan were created. Around 10 AM, a new "XP personification" appeared which was depicted with an aura of "cool and high performance," opposite to Me's clumsy, timid nature. This first XP personification, dubbed "Home Edition," was initially seen as a "stepchild" of Windows 2K due to its complex design, making it difficult to draw.</p>

<p>By 11 AM on August 6, 2003 another XP personification appeared. This version, in contrast to the other ones, had a calm demeanour and was well-received. Later that morning her creator introduced another design for XP: a voluptuous dark-haired woman in a bikini top and skirt. This version reflected the "memory usage IM size" concept with the idea that XP, known for consuming a lot of resources, would have a large bust. This design became iconic and was tied to the "I hate big tits" theme, further shaping the XP character.</p>

<p>Around 10:30 AM the <strong>2K personification</strong> was finalised, completing the trio of main Futaba OS characters. This design featured a school swimsuit-inspired look with a coat and short hair. A blue color scheme was established, solidifying the association of "2K = blue."</p>

<p>On August 8, 2003 the <strong>Windows CE personification</strong> debuted and on August 24, 2003, the first male character, <strong>Dr. Norton</strong>, was introduced, expanding the "OS Humanisation" concept which had been dominated by female characters.</p>

<p>On January 15, 2004 a new design for the XP personification emerged conceived as "XP = after 2 weeks of service pack 2." This new design, significantly different from the previous one was well received by users, becoming the standard look for XP. Saba made her debut around January 2004 during the heated period of the Futaba festival. The Linux monster, Linux-tan and Lindows also appeared during this time.</p>

<p>Around the same time <strong>95-tan</strong> debuted with the design of an elderly woman in a kimono to emphasise the OS's age that looked nothing like 95-tan. This was part of a festival celebrating "95 Personifications." After various interpretations by different artists the design was refined by Shiruaki by using the existing designs, ultimately resulting in the familiar image of a woman in a kimono based on the blossom wallpaper.</p>

<p>In February 2004 <strong>Mac OS anthropomorphs</strong> emerged as a rival to the Windows OS anthropomorphs. Alongside these actual <strong>male OS-tans</strong> also began to appear, referred to as "OS sons" to balance the predominantly female characters. Around late January 2004, the <strong>NT Mama</strong> design was solidified. Initially a simple design drawn in August 2003, NT Mama became the mother figure for both 2K and XP.</p>

<p>Following NT Mama <strong>Inu-T</strong> was introduced as a dog-like NT character, gaining popularity in early 2004. Eventually, <strong>Inu-T</strong>, the fully developed dog-like character, was treated as a separate character distinct from NT Mama. On January 29, 2005 <strong>Homeko</strong> was named, and a thread humorously speculated that Homeko might be a fujoshi who enjoys 801 doujin. This unexpected development led to a large-scale festival, and Homeko's popularity soared.</p>

<p>Throughout this period the first OS-tan Vault was created to keep the images contributed by the Nijiura community which initially featured characters like MS-DOS-tan, 98-tan, NT-tan, Me-tan, 2K-tan, XP-tan, and Dr. Norton in its first archived listing from October 4, 2003. By October 2004 the Vault had expanded its collection to include additional figures like 3.1-tan, 3.1, 95-tan, CE-tan, Longhorn-tan, Saba-tan, Lindows-tan, Linux-tan, Buster, McAfee, and Mac-tan. This update marked the final revision of the homepage with the content remaining mostly unchanged since then. The Vault remained online until approximately mid-2010, with the last known active archive dating from June 9, 2010.</p>

<p>Also around this time the Flash animation for <em>Trouble Windows</em> was released. It was first published on April 19, 2004, on the Heika Love website. Its first known appearance outside of Futaba Channel was on the Misfile site on April 28, 2004 so 9 days after. The animation gained further traction when it was uploaded to YouTube in November 12th, 2005 which likely helped it reach an even broader audience. You can view it on YouTube.</p>

<p>Me Aki is credited as the original creator, with the first OS personification being Me-tan. Over time, various versions of other personifications emerged such as those representing 2K, NT, XP, 95, 98, 98SE, and XP Home with different Toshiaki contributing designs and a particular painter compiling them. The entire Nijiura community played a role, contributing ideas and inspiration to the painters and craftsmen. Even users on Futaba Channel acknowledge that there is no single “canon” version of OS-tans, as noted in the FAQ for the image gallery.</p>

<p>The evolution of OS-tans is a direct result of the chaotic yet collaborative nature of the Nijiura board. While individual OS painters initially gave form to the OS girls, it was the combined efforts of many painters, craftsmen, and community members that defined their characters, allowing for multiple versions and widespread appeal. No single creator can claim full credit; while pioneers like Me Aki laid the groundwork while every member of the community, whether a painter, a craftsman, or an engaged participant has contributed to their development.</p>
