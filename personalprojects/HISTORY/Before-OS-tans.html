        <h1>0 - The Concept of Personification Before OS-tans</h1>
        <p>Before we even get into the origins of OS-tans
        themselves, we need to go way further back to around the
        90s, 1998 to be exact. The name “iMac Girl” may be familiar
        to some people as this was logically the “first” Moe
        Anthropomorphism or gijinka drawn by Satoshi "Toy" Igarashi
        that could fall under the "OS-tan" category. The reason for
        “first” being in quotations is because a lot of people see
        iMac Girl as the first ever, but this is actually
        incorrect.</p>
        <p>Depending on how you define technology gijinkas and
        OS-tans, the first are supposedly for both the PlayStation
        and Sega Saturn, known as “Game Console Gals” from December
        25, 1994, as seen on an earlier archive of his site. If you
        don't count the Game Console Gals as being the first, then
        it would be "G3 Girl” from March 24, 1998, who supposedly
        represents the iMac G3, “Bondi Blue Babe” who dates back to
        August 1998, and the “iCandies” who date back to March
        1999.</p>
        <p>During the same year as G3 Girl, OS Idol Win-chan from
        October 1998 for <em>TECHWIN Magazine</em> was made as some
        sort of mascot for the magazine. Most people tend to think
        that she is a catch-all character due to the fact it can be
        presumed she was never really meant to represent a single
        OS but rather be a catch-all, as the magazine nor CD-ROM
        (which can be found on the Internet Archive) never seems to
        mention if she is a single OS. For me personally, I think
        her being seen as representing Windows is subjective
        because I feel she represents the magazine only and is not
        really related to Windows itself?</p>
        <p>Similar to the above in 1999, you had the mascot for the
        "Linux MoeMoe Project" called Rimo, though that is not her
        official name. She was created because the creator wished
        to add the "moe" (cute and endearing) element to the Linux
        penguin mascot and imagined this character could be treated
        similarly to the Linux Penguin but in a Japanese manga
        style.</p>
        <p>What does this site have to do with anything else though
        if it is a site that exists as a platform for exploring and
        developing "moe-style" applications for Linux? It actually
        links to its own moe gijinka content and other moe gijinkas
        by other creators. Let's talk about moe gijinkas on the
        site itself first.</p>
        <h2>Language Musume ("Language Girls")</h2>
        <p>"Language Musume" (ランゲージ娘) is a project from the early
        2000s that personifies various computer languages and is
        part of the "Linux MoeMoe Project." Each character
        represents a different programming language, but the real
        aim is to build an open and free shared world where each
        operating system is compared to a “school” and each
        language is compared to a “female student” who attends the
        school.</p>
        <p>The project attempted to convince other users to join
        and make their own characters, even if they did not have
        any art skill but could contribute written descriptions. It
        was even encouraged to develop games using these
        characters, contributing to the creative and shared world.
        I'm not going to list every single character; however, 18
        were made in total, with the project lasting 6 months and
        21 days. A promotional movie in the style of an anime
        opening was even created which I found myself and uploaded
        on YouTube.</p>
        <p>The Language Musume page links to other moe gijinkas not
        related to their site as well.</p>
        <h2>Other Moe Gijinkas</h2>
        <p>This page was created as a tribute to the diverse
        characters and the researchers behind them, featuring
        technology and software that have been personified as
        girls. I suggest you look at the sites yourself listed, but
        if you don't want to look at the list, the characters
        include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Magical Toko-chan (BSD)</li>
          <li>Solaris-chan (Solaris)</li>
          <li>Unix Maid System Five-chan (Unix System-V)</li>
          <li>Direct☆Girl Wintel Miku-chan (Windows)</li>
          <li>Lina-chan with Linux (Linux)</li>
          <li>DIVE☆GIRL BigBlue Marin-chan (OS/2Warp4)</li>
          <li>Vine-chan with Magical Rod (VineLinux)</li>
          <li>Object-Oriented Girl Ruby-chan with Perl Sister (Ruby
          & Perl)</li>
          <li>JABAKO Project (JAVA)</li>
          <li>Project W3C-ko</li>
          <li>Mario-chan (Sigmarion)</li>
          <li>eZaurus-chan (eZaurus)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these characters has unique traits and
        represents the technology they are based on in creative
        ways. For example, Dive Girl BigBlue Marin-chan stands out
        for her setting, featuring both human and non-human
        characters. Some of these characters like Magical Toko go
        beyond into things like world-building. These projects show
        the deep enthusiasm and creativity of early fan
        communities, which laid the ground for later
        anthropomorphic movements like OS-tans.</p>
        <p>That being said, there are actually quite a few gijinkas
        related to technology and software prior to the creation of
        OS-tans themselves. Each one stands out in its own way,
        whether through their art style, backstory, or the
        universes they are in.</p>
