                        <p>Guardians of the School is based on my personal experiences in real life, therefore the setting for this project is based on an alternative universe of our universe. Most of the story takes place in <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/personalprojects/GOTS/meadowsridge.html">Meadows Ridge</a>, a fictional city in Australia..</p>
						
						<p>There is also the "Other World", more commonly known as <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/personalprojects/GOTS/OzzerVorld.html">Ozzer Vorld</a>. It's a place where ghosts and people with supernatural powers can go to as an escape from reality, but also a place where evil spirits who are contained for their crimes attempt to reach out into reality to escape their containment.</p>
						
						<p>You can read more about Meadows Ridge or Ozzer Vorld by going to the page linked in this the sections of text above or below you can pick to look at separate areas in Meadows Ridge or Ozzer Vorld.</p>

            /* this seems like a lot for just one font and I would have to agree 
    but I wanted to include an example of how to include a custom font.
    If you download a font file you can upload it onto your Neocities
    and then link it! Many fonts have separate files for each style
    (bold, italic, etc. T_T) which is why there are so many!
