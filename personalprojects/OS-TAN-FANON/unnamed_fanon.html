          <h2>The Mainframe’s Unnamed Fanon</h2>
          <p>
            I briefly discovered OS-tans in 2017 but didn’t get into them much.
            I don’t think I even saw the OS-tans first, but instead,
            browser-kuns…
          </p>
          <p>
            The beginning of The Mainframe starts in 2018. This is when the real
            deal started. Most stuff from this year is mostly lost as I had
            purged it during 2019 however little bits of it remain scattered
            across platforms such as Discord and Wattpad.
          </p>
          <p>
            I must admit I am angry at myself for this. This was also the time I
            began high school so OS-tans were an escape for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time I often called OS-tans “OS-Tans” as it felt right
            to me, but the T in tan is not supposed to be a capital. I also made
            some characters too, those being listed here unchanged from old
            sources I still have:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>9-tan</li>
            <li>Ichi (Original Iphone-Tan)</li>
            <li>Petya 6-tan</li>
            <li>Petya 7-tan</li>
            <li>Mikase-Tan (Windows Update-Tan)</li>
            <li>Yatsumi-Tan (The Windows 10 upgrade notification)</li>
            <li>AVG-Tan</li>
            <li>ClamWin-Tan</li>
            <li>CCleaner-Kun</li>
            <li>Petya-Tan</li>
            <li>NotPetya-Tan</li>
            <li>WannaCry-Tan</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            9-tan is Windows 9-tan, one of the first few characters I made. She
            was pretty much a reskinned Miku Hatsune but had the ability to walk
            through mirrors and was the sidekick to the protagonist of my old
            story. 9-tan did have some other designs but the recoloured miku was
            her well-known one lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was not much on Ichi besides the fact she had an electrostaff
            like from Star Wars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Petya 6 and Petya 7 were siblings, representing the two versions of
            the Petya virus (Petya and NotPetya).
          </p>
          <p>
            Petya 6 was portrayed as a short girl who wielded a naginata and
            “lock bombs” and wore a white skull mask and a black jacket with
            ASCII skull on the back. Petya 7 was similar but instead, she had a
            bardiche and kunai. Petya 6 and Petya 6 have mixed up outfit colours
            due to my bad research at the time. With the power of AI I can see
            what my old characters could have looked like. This is Petya 6-tan
            who was also known as “NotPetya-tan”. AI doesn’t make her very well
            though like with the mask
          </p>
          <p>
            These were the four main ones I can remember. There may be more, but
            besides the ones listed on this page, most are lost to time.

          <h2>Auksani</h2>
          <p>
            The unknown fanon also had its own language called “Auksani”. At the
            time of making this unknown fanon, it was 196 years old. Now that I
            think about it, I think this was purely for “teh cools” at the time.

          <h2>Setting</h2>
          <p>
            The setting… wasn’t so bad then. Although hard to recall details,
            one of the main things of this setting was that the Retrograde
            Conglomerate, then known as the Vintage Federation, was on a
            floating island.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an old story I wrote it was shown that literature could not be
            split from reality. I don’t think the setting was very established
            at the time.
