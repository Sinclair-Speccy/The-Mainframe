         <h1>Accuracy of Information and research</h1>
         <p>Accuracy of information... man. When it comes to accuracy of information I find myself wondering what is the point sometimes.</p>

         <p>As you translate some of the sources used for research on my personal OS-tan wiki, you might notice OS-tans are flexible on Futaba Channel. What I mean by this is that while some details are consistent, others are not and are listed as canon in other places, even if it is not stated that the information is posed as canon.</p>
     
         <p>Everyone contributed to making OS-tans at Futaba, and everyone's idea of them will vary, removing things they don’t like and adding things they prefer. These headcanons (or different ideas for a character) will end up on other wikis such as the Japanese ones without any actual source. Although "challenged", I have seen characters like 3.1-tan be said from 2004 in a single image (6-c) of the Trouble Windows Opening as the girl inside a CRT screen labelled 3.1, though with a different design, notably with blue eyes and Inu-T be said to have first appeared in a single image (6-c) of the Trouble Windows Opening as the girl with the blue ponytail hair, though she didn’t have dog ears.</p>
     
         <p>A lot is left to interpretation like in other fandoms (Touhou & Vocaloid). Older threads from Futaba are gone (as older ones are deleted), so we will never know what was truly intended by their creators, and some sources are IP-restricted.</p>
     
         <p>All of this is why the information on my personal OS-tan wiki is based upon observing artworks, looking at the IP-restricted content with a VPN, and the other wikis/sources. People should consider this wiki as a valuable resource like every other source, but not an absolute authority. People should also remember that OS-tans vary across person with interpretation and design.</p>
     
         <p>Futaba Channel themselves have never had a formal or official wiki to begin with, nor is the ふたば★二次裏 wiki itself the official wiki from Futaba. All ふたば★二次裏 does is document stuff from Futaba Channel after an older wiki which used to do the same disappeared.</p>
             
             <p>Another thing to mention is that everyone is looking at Futaba from an outsiders point of view and not actually a member of Futaba itself, so it’s not like they’re going to know who is and isn’t actually popular enough. Its a group of western people trying to peer into a locked community because Futaba is closed to outsiders in some ways.</p>
