         <h1>About</h1>
    <p>You most likely ended up here on this section of the site by accidentally getting here, or editing the URL to get here on purpose.</p>
    <p>So.. what happens when you get a former community that is dismissive, or seems to be too restrictive to one person who was wanting to encourage newer ideas? You get the lead-in to <i>OS-tan Rendezvous.</i></p>
    <p>And OS-tan Rendezvous to me can be considered a "significant" part of the OS-tan fandom in the west because it sort of started the whole "nothing is canon" thing that I tend to rant on about.</p>
    <p>Back in around 2019 OS-tan Rendezvous came into existence because back then OS-tan Collections did not want randoms editing the wiki with "fanfiction-y" content:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I need to explain why I am hesitant on Wiki access and what not.<br>
        The "Canon" of OS-tans per-say is what seems to be accepted by Futaba or the majority of artists on Eastern sites.</p>
        <p>VolareVia's concern about the Wiki being treated as the OS-tan Wiki is valid. The issue however is that it is the only OS-tan wiki. (at least that I know of) So in a sense we kind of are officialish in a way. To much of the interest outside of this community, the Wiki serves as a useful tool to look at the design behind the characters, and understand them better. Years before I became involved on the forum I only used the Wiki and gallery to look at images of -tans/-kuns and understand their designs better. We are the 3rd result for OS-tan on duckduckgo, bing and Yahoo, and number two on Google and Ask.</p>
        <p>The Annex project from what I can tell is (f/c)anon generated out of users on the forum. Which is not to say it is any less valid than anything else, because there is no true canon. The purposed Appendix has as much right on the Wiki too if it is agreed upon enough.</p>
        <p>Bloating something like 95-tan's character page with many details from someone's work that feel fan fictiony, editing out details on a character or another project to conform more with someone else's view should not be allowed. The work that is there has a right to be respected. For example we can't just agree that Xp-tan and 2K-tan are together and update their profiles to say as much. That would be confusing, especially as there is little to no art to back it up.</p>
        <p>Wikis can serve as a great tool for producing written fiction, but as we do serve as the official unofficial website for OS-tans we need to remember to not get too fan fictiony when editing the Wiki in places that visitors might come to get relevant information on OS-tans.</p>
        <p>We have new users with a great eagerness to clean the Wiki and add to it. This is great, but I'm writing this as a set of guidelines that should be followed when doing so. The wiki needs a lot of work; there are many broken images, and sloppy looking pages. It would also be nice to see some citation and credit given to the many artists both on this site and around the world that have drawn the images and comics that make OS-tans/kuns what we love.</p>
        <p>If you want to have wiki access you can DM me. But please tell me what you want to work on and how you think you can help improve the wiki. I'll grant you access if I think you can help.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Of course there were more reasons. Despite the above saying that there is "no canon" information, what is there is still posed as canon because it is a mess. Why? OSC's Annex project was not split properly on the Futaba character's pages.</p>
