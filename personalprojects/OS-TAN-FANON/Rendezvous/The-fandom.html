         <h1>The Fandom</h1>
    <p>Personally... I think the western side is a mess.</p>

  <p>There is a lot I could say about it, and this is technically the longer version of what I have on my fanon wiki, which was kept short to prevent people from crying:</p>

  <p>When you think of OS-tans, I assume the first thing you think of is the “main cast” such as XP-tan, 95-tan, Me-tan, 2K-tan, and so on. When you think of the “canon” characters, you would likely think of the same characters I mentioned before.</p>

  <p>Your average fan wouldn’t think much else besides admiring them. However, after being in three OS-tan communities (or related ones), they all had their flaws and issues with how information is presented, how research is done, and so on. In fact, these flaws and issues are what made me even want to write this in the first place. But to even mention these flaws, we have to talk about how OS-tans even came to be in the first place. Luckily for me, when I was researching unrelated OS-tan stuff, I came across a blog that discussed some of the issues that I see, so some of my thoughts will be based on that blog along with personal experience. That will be linked at the bottom.</p>

  <p>Now, OS-tans. What are they? It makes more sense to call them OS Musume, but the reason for that will be explained later. Originating from the Futaba’s Nijiura image board, OS Musume are moe personified characters of operating systems, primarily Windows. They are commonly called "OS-tan," but the term “OS-tan” is more used by the English-speaking part of the community, while OS Musume is used within Futaba. The concept of moe personification isn’t all new. It seems to be well-known that Futaba started the trend.</p>

  <p>Nijiura is one of the boards on Futaba Channel, and the nature of it is, well… interesting. While there is NSFW content, it seems that the Nijiura board is known for some chaos but also the fact there’s an unspoken agreement on image use. Members understand that images posted can be freely used as references, modified, or incorporated into stories. There is also a sense of collaboration as it's common for images to be edited, such as line drawings being colored or further refined, often in unexpected ways. This collaborative effort can transform trivial stories or collages into significant narratives and is a reason as to why there may be many edits of an OS-tan drawing (e.g., some Windows 95 wallpapers).</p>

  <p>While there is occasional criticism, it's less common than expected. The community tends to reject changes that aren't enjoyable, and altering an image in a negative way is rare. This process of chaotic yet creative evolution is how OS-tans were born and grew within Futaba’s Nijiura board in the first place.</p>

  <p>That being said, there are many “Toshiaki,” or miscellaneous groups of people. Many of them are artists or “craftsmen” who make collages and gifs. Although anonymous, there are doujinshi, commercial artists, and even artists whose main activities are limited to Futaba. These are the people who made OS-tans in a literal sense.</p>

  <p>"Enjoyable and exciting" (E&E) is a key principle guiding the community's interactions. Even simple images, original drawings, and seemingly trivial replies can spark unexpected discussions and lead to the creation of new topics. Many of the community's well-known topics likely originated from the organic and spontaneous nature of Nijiura interactions, starting from minor posts and evolving into significant discussions. This is clear in the OS-tan fan book with Me-tan who started it all because, according to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book, on August 6, 2003, when an image of the System Properties for Windows Me was posted, someone commented, "But Windows Me is cute even though it's no good." This highlighted Windows Me's human-like quality—cute yet clumsy, thus, lovable despite its flaws. It was suggested that Windows Me was not just an inorganic entity but had a human touch to it.</p>

  <p>Toshiaki and others present agreed with this opinion. Following this trend, around 7 AM, two "Me personifications" were quickly improvised, marking the beginning of the larger "Futaba OS Personification" movement. On Futaba Channel, when interesting material or ideas emerge from chats, replies, or posted images, they are not ignored. Instead, they are transformed into collages, drawings, joke replies, or comments, regardless of their quality or improvisation. This embodies the creative spirit of Futaba Channel, where spontaneous collaboration leads to significant trends, referred to as "festivals."</p>

  <p>Me Aki is the original creator with the first OS personification being Me-tan. Over time, various versions of other personifications were created, such as 2K, NT, XP, 95, 98, 98SE, and XP Home. The designs were presented by different Toshiaki and put together by a particular painter. Painters created different versions of OS-tans using various techniques like 3D modelling and collage. The artwork was collected and stored in a "vault," and the famous OS-tan Flash was created during this process. The community of Nijiura was involved in the development of OS-tan, with residents contributing ideas and inspiration to painters and craftsmen. The creation and nurturing of OS-tans involved not just painters and craftsmen but also other members of the community.</p>

  <p>All of this was possible because of the chaotic nature of the Nijiura board. It can be said that it was each OS painter who first gave form to OS girls, but it is this involvement of many painters, craftsmen, and others that has given them the character they have today and enabled them to be created in a variety of versions and widely drawn. And it is this chaotic world of the Nijiura community that allows this to happen.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it is not that a specific painter created the character (depending on who we talk about), but that an unspecified group of people, who existed as Toshiaki, created and nurtured the character. In a sense, everyone made them. Yes, individual creators made the first ones, but everyone else added to their character, so it makes sense to say everyone made them. Those who are not painters or craftsmen are involved in the birth and development of OS Musume. The painters and craftsmen would not have been able to raise OS girls to this level without them, and the painters and craftsmen who were actually involved understand this better than anyone else.</p>

  <p>The Nijiura community operates on a system where images are posted, responded to, and further developed through collaboration so community members contribute by adding stories, attributes, and designs to the characters through their responses.</p>

  <p>This collaborative process involves artists drawing based on community input, craftsmen creating collages, and further iterations that refine the characters. Over time, these contributions lead to the creation of major versions of OS girls while preserving minor variations in memory; therefore, the growth of OS-tans is a collaborative effort involving many Toshiaki.</p>

  <p>With that huge chunk of text said, if there are no real rules aside from not claiming the characters as your own, why do people say there are "canon" characters? Ever yet, why is there a community gatekeeping the term OS-tans to Futaba's characters only?</p>

  <p>I had to use a bit of the internet for this, but way back when OS-tan Collection's wiki came about, there was the whole Annex Project by C-Chan, which aimed to pretty much make one large fanon for everyone's characters on the forums. I suspect the wiki was created for this as the forum had its limits. On the wiki, there is a section called "List of Canon OS-tan Characters," which is what I personally believe started this misconception of there being a canon, as a lot of details are left up to interpretation by the user. The site has been around for so long people see the main characters as the "canon" ones.</p>

  <p>In the West, the idea of "canon" often implies a fixed, official storyline, where continuity and consistency are crucial. This concept has roots in religious traditions, where "canon" referred to the official, accepted texts of the church. Applying this expectation to other cultures can lead to misunderstandings, especially when engaging with stories from the East.</p>

  <p>Eastern storytelling, as seen in traditions like the Mahabharata and Jataka Tales, often allows for multiple retellings, each with its own variations. These stories prioritise characters, their personalities, and their impact over strict chronological order or consistency. When a character resonates deeply within a society, people are encouraged to add their versions, contributing to the collective narrative. In this context, what might be labeled as "fan fiction" in the West could become part of the mainstream story in the East if it gains enough popularity.</p>
             
  <p>Another thing with this is that OS-tan Collections isn't the only place that seems to be enforcing "rules" on OS-tans when there are no real rules on how to portray the characters. The Moeverse, which I used to be at, restricts the term "OS-tan" to Futaba's characters only as if only they can use the term? 1. Futaba doesn't even use the term OS-tan that much, if at all. They use OS Musume instead. 2. There was a term that was coined for non-Windows OS-tans, and it's OS-kun. Would it make sense to gatekeep this term when it's not even used within Futaba themselves? 3. If we must gatekeep, what about other stuff like software and other OS personifications that aren't OS-kun?</p>

  <p>I'm aware that I might've upset some people with this, but it's something that I wanted to talk about for a while. I'm not mad at anyone but rather the situation with the characters themselves and how the fanbase is. There are no rules, but people tend to act like there are, which creates this sort of mess with the characters and who should even be called OS-tans.</p>

  <p>The blog I mentioned is <a href="https://oresama2chan.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-203.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Of course, that’s just what I think...</p>
