        <h1>2019: Turbulence</h1>
        <p>2019 was the year everything changed. In the Discord server that was called "OS-tan Collections" without anyone from OS-tan Collections being there the new site owner, Goujer, joined the server.  The real OS-tan Collections Discord server predated this server I joined in 2018 by one year (the real server being from 2017 and the server I was in is from 2018). Around this time as in 2019 I was in my second year of high school.</p>  
			 
		<p>There us a lot to unpack with this however I try to explain everything as much as I can the best I can. This section of the site's layout is directly ripped from the archived version of OS-tan Rendezvous's site.</p>
			 
			 <p>This page is a carbon copy of the rules section of the OS-tan Rendezvous website however instead there are no rules listed here, since there don't need to be any rules here.</p>
			 
			 <p>To navigate, use the bottons at the top above this box. It is kinda split up into years and such so oh well.</p>
			 
			 <p>Despite the disclaimer at the bottom saying the banner was made by the well known OS-tan artist Kattlanna, it actually uses the art made by Sato</p>
