        <h1>Current State of the Fandom</h1>
        <p>With knowing all this, what is the current state of the fandom? I would say "dead". Why? The fandom had its heyday way back in the early 2000s and 2010s if we talk about the western part of the fandom. From what was a bustling community, that being OS-tan Collections, became a wasteland as the years ticked closer to the "modern" world.</p>

<p>Using the Wayback Machine we can see that during the 2000s and 2010s the forums were literally ALIVE with activity (Moreso in the early 2000s and early 2010s). Most accounts seem to have been abandoned with no one using them, nor having the system purge older accounts.</p>

<p>In fact, I don't think we even need to use the Wayback Machine for this as you can go through the oldest posts and see that most posts are from 2005, 2006, 2007, and so on for the 2000s. For the 2010s, you get 2017, 2015, 2013 and such. There was both a lot more activity in the "Lounge" and "OS-tan discussions" compared to now. Now, there was a little bit of activity during 2019 I suppose but this was on OSC's locked away Discord server that people used to be part of, but that died down too. It did not last long as activity was shifted to OS-tan Rendezvous for the people who wanted to discuss ideas until it died from itself. There still hardly was any OS-tan discussion in 2020.</p>

<p>Most activity nowadays at OSC is just two people talking to each other without any actual proper discussion on the forums. Seeing the admin who hosts it try to revive the place by doing edits to the wiki is not going to bring it back either. Sure, it may clean it up but why is it only being done now when it should have been done ages ago? One moderator could have fixed it all years ago but they did not want to do it all on their own and no one offered to help.</p>

<p>OSR started what OSC rejected, but now with OSR gone OSC is finally taking what OSC should have done in the first place instead of being too restrictive in the first place with newer ideas. But I feel they are taking it too late. If these are meant to be "shots" at me for once being at OS-tans.moe and promoting what OSR once did before I left because of a misunderstanding, it is not working. In fact, I may or may not laugh at it. They are trying to revive a dead corpse.</p>

<p>Times have changed and this means people's preferences to what platforms to have communities on has changed, meaning that if OS-tans were to become super popular again they are going to want to use a platform that is more "modern" as forums are seen as old. And as if OSC are going to open up their Discord server if they fear the "soap opera gang".</p>

<p>I actually ended up discovering that OSC's server has become more of a friend group with it being called an OS-tan server put in quotations and invites aren't allowed. The server has some notable members but I guess even they don't wish to interact with new people as they have moved on with life. Although I haven't seen anyone ask to join the server ever since I have been gone from OSC I think if someone was to ask for an invite, someone from OSC might blame me when I cannot be the root cause of everything.</p>

<p>My memory is rusty and I need to find the actual message again but at one point, it was even admitted by the server owner herself while using a mod to say it that the Discord was locked away because of "stalkers" but also another admin that said "No new people, because moderating Discord is harder than moderating a forum." OSC is already not keeping up with the times if they want activity. Not every person will use a forum.</p>

<p>As for OS-tans.moe, it makes more sense to describe it as the Moeverse. I might have slight more hope and mercy for them as it is a fairly new project but even the Moeverse is quiet. Its wikis, mainly the Moeverse wiki and at times, OS-tans.moe, seem to get more activity compared to OSC. But even with the Moeverse advertising itself as "The Moeverse is a place for anyone interested in anything related to moe, notably moe characters and their universes. Its Community strives to make it a warm and safe place to spend some enjoyable and inspiring time.", there is not much activity on its forums either. The statistics state that there are 20 members but only a handful of them talk, mainly only two when they bothered since most accounts there seem to have been ignored and abandoned.</p>

<p>The most recent forum post is from the 3rd of February, 2024. The Moeverse wiki may also list 4 universes but two of them have seemingly been abandoned, one having its last edit during the 20th of March, 2023 if we talk about the last thing added to that fanon/universe, the other being from the 20 of December, 2023 if we follow the same "last thing added to that fanon/universe" stuff.</p>

<p>But Sinclair! Not everyone needs to actively work on stuff! That is true, yes, but I am pointing out that these places are quiet because most people can't find these places, these places appear dead or are simply not interested in making a full-blown universe.</p>

<p>Plus, the Moeverse has executed the whole concept of fanons/universes way better than OSC has so I can give credits to the Moeverse for that. If you really care about how OSC is doing it they are simply going by this logic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I got what I think to be a pretty baller idea for the writing stuff. Instead of "fanon" and all that crap, we have a "universe" namespace for people to write their stuff in! Fanon kinda sucks as a label because there isn't really a canon anyway. We could also shift the idea from expansions to alternate versions by using a <q>universe:Windows_95_(MyCoolUniverseName)</q> if certain stories people are writing make sense that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Moeverse is utilising a cleaner infobox to use, color boxes for hair and eye color so it is more visual and even full on colored infoboxes!</p>

<p>On a more serious note, I think if we were to revive the OS-tan fandom, some things need to be done.</p>

<p>But let’s also consider the fact that the fandom is so niche it’s one of those ones where it is somewhat unknown and one where people are going to go “ew anime”. I see people every once in a blue moon very interested in reviving the fandom like I once was in 2018, but at this rate it’s pretty much dead. Hell, look at the Madobe family stuff. We haven’t even gotten an official Windows 11-tan. Reviving the OS-tan fandom would require a very serious effort from both old and new fans alike but how many people are actually interested in doing that effort?</p>

<p>I’ve seen ideas on how to revive it such as making more content such as comics, videos and even a hashtag but this alone isn’t enough. Personally to me, the only way I’ll end up seeing the fandom being revived is if an official Windows 11-tan was made but this doesn’t seem to be happening any time soon.</p>
