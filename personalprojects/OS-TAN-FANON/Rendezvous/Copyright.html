         <h1>Copyright and Licenses</h1>
     <p>Ehhh... copyright and licenses in regards to OS-tans is a touchy subject to me because of my personal views on copyright in general.</p>
    <p>The next few lines should be taken with a grain of salt, nor do I condone some things as this is not legal advice.</p>
    <p>You see, back in the day, you had DejaVu trying to claim ownership of the Futaba OS-tans, which led to Me-tan and XP Pro-tan's creators making copyright for their characters respectively. This mess happened years ago in the 2000s and has since passed on. The Madobe OS-tan's also have their own copyright from around 2013.</p>
    <p>OS-tan Collections, on the other hand, was different. While they did not suffer from anyone trying to claim ownership, they had well-known artists create characters for the Annex project without much thought to formal rights. It was a collaborative project and presumed that anyone who added anything there could be freely used.</p>
    <p>Respecting the copyright of the creators is important, yet you still see people out there selling OS-tan merchandise on sites like Etsy and RedBubble and making NSFW artworks. This is the case with almost any fandom, like Touhou and others. It's sometimes phrased as if these creators will chase after you, but that is not necessarily the case, at least from my perspective. ME-tan and XP-tan's creators don't seem active anymore, and Windows Navi+ isn't around, so while the copyright still applies, are they really going to pursue legal action? The only things I could really see happening is someone getting hounded by Futaba Channel or the creators of Windows Navi+ sending a letter out to stop it.</p>
    <p>Licenses, on the other hand, are a different matter and this more so applies to the Moeverse and people making individual licenses for their projects. I find myself asking what if someone doesn't acknowledge the licenses set for each person's project because:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Limited Resources</strong>: The Moeverse, being a small site, likely operates on a limited budget and may not have the financial resources to pursue legal action against violators of the licenses unlike big corporations.</li>
        <li><strong>Jurisdictional Challenges</strong>: The internet is global, and infringers could be located in different countries with different legal systems. Enforcing a license across international borders can be incredibly complex and often impractical.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring Difficulties</strong>: Monitoring and detecting violations across the web can be time-consuming. Who is going to go out of their way to track every single site to combat offenders? The sheer scale of the internet makes comprehensive enforcement a daunting task.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While individuals can create their own licenses on the site, I do wonder how effective enforcement would be. The same concerns apply to my own fanon/universe.</p>
