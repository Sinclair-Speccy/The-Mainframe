         <h1>Inspiration</h1>
      <p>After being at 3 OS-tan communities (or related), they all had their flaws and issues. If you can look past the old Deja Vu vs Futaba drama, taking inspiration from others seems to be common in some parts of the fandom, more so the western side. In the Trouble Windows fan book, you will see that characters like 95-tan are simply someone taking other concepts for 95-tans and combining them into one character. OS-tan Collection's Windows 1.0-tan and PC-DOS-tan are inspired by an early Windows 1.0-tan from 2006 from Futaba (more info on my other OS-tan wiki about this), and XP Kaki-Aki's MS-DOS-tan and my fanon use older designs from Operating Superstars.</p>

    <p>Juzo-kun's design for <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/juzo-kun/art/OS-tan-fanart-Linux-tan-15714339">their Linux-tan</a> (the geared helmet and spear) references the earlier human <a href="https://www.ostan-collections.net/gallery/galleries/OS-tans/Linux/Linu1173659558083.jpg">Futaba design</a>, in which subsequent Linux personifications are either based on (or incorporate) features from Juzo-kun's Linux-tan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.ostan-collections.net/gallery/_data/i/galleries/Members_Contributions/C-Chan/Scrap_Art/Chibi_Linux-tan_-_ChibiLinux-tan-me.png">C-Chan's Linux-tan</a> is a combination of both Juzo-kun's and Futaba's Linux-tan. For the Futaba part, she is depicted with hime-cut hair, a blue and gold billed-and-horned helmet, and ribbon-covered spear; however, she is wearing an outfit based on Juzo-kun's characterization with a modified color scheme.</p>

    <p>Besides PC-DOS and the Annex 1.0-tan, it seems that inspiration is part of the Western part of the fandom since OS-tan Collections was created, as these designs came from there.</p>

    <p>Inspiration seems to be a core part of what made the Western fandom the way it is. Don't feel like you aren't allowed to use other designs for inspiration, as there should be no shame in being inspired by OS-tans, even making them derivatives for jokes and such, but always ask for permission if possible if you can contact the person, giving them credit :).</p>

    <p>But why am I even mentioning this in the first place? I've seen a place have like 3 different rules in regards to inspiration such as it not being allowed, not being allowed on the "original content" (mind you 95-tan is technically based on someone else's 95-tan if we use the OS-tan fan book) section and derivative works being allowed all under the same domain. if you know me well enough you might know what place I am talking about. It icks me because it is not consistent and seems like that it is saying characters that are derivatives aren't original enough depending on what they look like... let alone the rules most likely would not have changed if I showed the r/OStan discord server the rules on OG content as the rule was "A Moe Character with a well defined design and personality, that is well developed and has existing original visual artwork. The Character must be original and not a derivative of an existing one.", leading to someone asking in the other server and me being curious on what the admin would say.</p>
