                <h2>Man, this old magic system sucked so hard</h2>
                <p>Before 2024, the magic system that was originally used for Phone-tans/kuns was scrapped as the way I was portraying it did not work. The old magic system is not much different as it used 0G to 5G as a "power scale" of sorts but it also utilised "antennas" phones had for the "strength" of a character. Typically, this meant with phones that had a visible antenna were considered stronger while with something like the iPhone 4, the antennagate problem meant she had weaker strength.</p>
							<p>This lead to a mess of problems such as trying to keep things consistent as it does not make sense for a phone with a visible antenna to be stronger than one that does not have a visible antenna. The whole concept of 0G to 5G as a power scale and the phones that had a visible antenna being "stronger" led to me scrapping it because it just did not work at the time.</p>

                <h2>An accidental revival</h2>
                <p>During 2024 as I was working on the next big update after transferring all the old pages over from Wordpress I researched more into Motorola and the history of car phones. I ended up finding out that AT&T proposed the concept of a cellular phone network and that by the early 1970s, AT&T and Motorola both announced plans for high-capacity mobile telephone systems based on cellular technology.</p>
							<p>When you think of cellular technology you might think of phones or a cellular network, moreso the most common example of a cellular network being a mobile phone (cell phone) network. 1G to 5G are generations of cellular networks so this ended up being an accidental revival of the magic system. When I realised that I had done an accidental revival of the old magic system I decided that I would try it again.</p>

                <h2>The current magic system</h2>
                <p>The current magic system for phones was made by both the Motorola Motorcade and the Alliance of Telecommunication Titan after the Alliance of Telecommunication Titan proposed the concept of "cellular crystals". The Motorola Motorcade discovered then discovered the type of crystal that could solve these problems that AT&T had proposed. This new type of crystal was a game-changer. They were large crystals and putting them into metal towers allowed for the creation of small adjacent cells within the communication network, each with its own frequency. </p>
							<p>These crystals could be broken down to smaller crystals which then could be placed in wands and staffs to draw the magic from the towers. Early experiments revealed the crystal's potential to enhance communication, but their true power is yet to be fully understood.</p>
