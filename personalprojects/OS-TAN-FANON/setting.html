                <h2>Species, Life, and Death</h2>
                <p>Most OS-tans and such could be considered “human” except for a few like GENIAC-tan (who is a puppet) and the older mainframes.</p>
            </section>
			
			<section>
                <h2>Humans</h2>
                <p>Humans and developers do exist in the mainframe, but words mostly speak of them and are not really seen. Developers do not really control any faction either.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Mainframes</h2>
                <p>The mainframes are portrayed as large mechanical machines due to the fact most older machines had bits and pieces you could see, but they have human forms they can morph into.</p>
				<p>They were created by humans for helping with tasks mostly during WWII and the Cold War, examples being COLOSSUS, ENIAC, Whirlwind and BESM. They slowly gained the ability to morph into humans so they did not feel out of place.</p>
				<p>When in their human form they had all the skills and needs humans require so mainframes can appear as humans with super-human powers. Mainframes will look biologically similar to human beings.</p>
				<p>However, some of them may be hesitant to morph into their human forms like COLOSSUS who was betrayed after her helpers burned documents about her, let alone kept her existence a secret.</p>
				<p>When a mainframe dies, its mechanical parts are usually stored in buildings or places like museums or completely tossed. If they are in their human form when this happens, they will immediately return back to their mechanical form.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Other Characters</h2>
                <p>Other characters in this case refers to two other categories that aren’t mainframes or something else. These other classes are hardware, operating systems, programs, malware and maybe some smaller ones.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
				<p>Hardware-tans/kuns includes two smaller classes within it however it is its own category to group them all together. Although mainframes can be considered hardware, they still stay in their separate section because of the differences they have for their portrayal. The two smaller classes are hardware are computer-tans/kuns and phone-tans/kuns. This also includes prototype hardware that were never released such as the Commodore 65 and iBook G5.</p>

<p>Most of them are not machines like the mainframes but instead are supernatural humans who can do “human things” such as eating and drinking human cuisine and displaying other human bodily functions however they can also do “computer things.”</p>

<p>Some examples of non-machiney computer-tans/kuns and phone-tans/kuns are The Mainframe’s versions of iPhone 3G-tan, Byt-8-kun and MikroMikko 1-tan.</p>

<p>There are some characters who are under this category that are not really human-like nor machine such as GENIAC-tan who is a puppet.</p>

<p>It is hard for these characters to die however if they do die, they die like normal humans do. They can also live longer than most humans due to emulation.</p>
				
				<h3>Operating Systems</h3>
<p>Operating systems are well, operating systems. This includes mobile OSes like Android and iOS, Multi-edition OSes like Vista and Ubuntu, OSes for mainframe systems like MULTICS and ITS and embedded OSes like QNX and ROMDOS. This also includes prototype OSes that were never released such as Windows 9.</p>
<p>They are the exact same as hardware with their own little differences.</p>

<h3>Programs</h3>
<p>The Mainframe only has one notable example of a program character which is The Mainframe version of Norton-kun. Others may come in the future.</p>
<p>They are the exact same as hardware with their own little differences.</p>

<h3>Malware</h3>
<p>Malware is portrayed as experimental creatures who can have extra body parts such as eyes and arms or are just borderline edgy like Festering Hate.</p>

<h3>Threshold’s (Windows 10 Threshold-tan) Species</h3>
<p>Threshold’s species is a mysterious alien race that has been on the home planet in The Mainframe since the 1990s. The first one of her kind is known to be a member of the Sun Microsystems faction. However, Threshold’s species is also a mystery. No one knows where they came from or what their ultimate goals are. Some believe that they are simply a benevolent race that wants to help the other factions in the Mainframe, while others believe that they have a more sinister agenda.</p>
<p>The Decimas are a notable example of the mysterious alien race. Besides this, some features of this race are elf ears, tails with furry bits on the end and a deep understanding of technology. They also look like normal humans in terms of basic anatomy. Some other examples include Windows NT-kun and the Windows 11-kuns.</p>
<p>The true name of this species is unknown.</p>

                <h2>The Land and Setting</h2>
                <p>When it comes to the setting of my fanon, things get a little weird. Once there was no setting at all so the idea of having one was a gradual thing.</p>
				<p>When I first started working on my fanon before I even knew what a fanon was there was no setting beside the fact the Vintage Federation was on a floating island. A lot of ideas from this period are hard to track down since notes have been lost, therefore it is hard to determine whether there was a real setting or not for 2018. It wasn’t until 2023 that I decided to think more about the setting, a map and such.</p>
				<p>Below is the old Appendix map from perhaps 2019 or something. I cannot remember the exact date this is from but note the old faction names such as the 3.14 Society, Hidden Onion Organization and Vaporwave. These factions no longer exist except for the Vaporwave one which may use a new name.</p>

        <figcaption>So purple...</figcaption>
    </figure>
			<p>The only real parts of The Mainframe’s setting were seen in mainly 1955 from 2020 even though it did not get far. 1955 showed that at least a part of the land had snow and showed that OS-tans/kuns interacted with humans, let alone worked with them in normal jobs as Simon works at well, a bookshop run by humans.</p>	
				<p>In 2023 however, I decided to focus on the setting more. It’s sort of a combination of a fantasy cyberpunk world and the real world but is mainly fantasy.</p>
