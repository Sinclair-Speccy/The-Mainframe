            are seperate pages for a more in-depth of certain things that belong

          <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">Magic System</h2>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <h1>Phone Magic System</h1>
            <h2>Man, this old magic system sucked so hard</h2>
            <p>
              Before 2024, the magic system that was originally used for
              Phone-tans/kuns was scrapped as the way I was portraying it did
              not work. The old magic system is not much different as it used 0G
              to 5G as a "power scale" of sorts but it also utilised "antennas"
              phones had for the "strength" of a character. Typically, this
              meant with phones that had a visible antenna were considered
              stronger while with something like the iPhone 4, the antennagate
              problem meant she had weaker strength.
            </p>
            <p>
              This lead to a mess of problems such as trying to keep things
              consistent as it does not make sense for a phone with a visible
              antenna to be stronger than one that does not have a visible
              antenna. The whole concept of 0G to 5G as a power scale and the
              phones that had a visible antenna being "stronger" led to me
              scrapping it because it just did not work at the time.
            </p>
            <h2>An accidental revival</h2>
            <p>
              During 2024 as I was working on the next big update after
              transferring all the old pages over from Wordpress I researched
              more into Motorola and the history of car phones. I ended up
              finding out that AT&T proposed the concept of a cellular phone
              network and that by the early 1970s, AT&T and Motorola both
              announced plans for high-capacity mobile telephone systems based
              on cellular technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you think of cellular technology you might think of phones or
              a cellular network, moreso the most common example of a cellular
              network being a mobile phone (cell phone) network. 1G to 5G are
              generations of cellular networks so this ended up being an
              accidental revival of the magic system. When I realised that I had
              done an accidental revival of the old magic system I decided that
              I would try it again.
            </p>
            <h2>The current magic system</h2>
            <p>
              The current magic system for phones was made by both the Motorola
              Motorcade and the Alliance of Telecommunication Titan after the
              Alliance of Telecommunication Titan proposed the concept of
              "cellular crystals". The Motorola Motorcade discovered then
              discovered the type of crystal that could solve these problems
              that AT&T had proposed. This new type of crystal was a
              game-changer. They were large crystals and putting them into metal
              towers allowed for the creation of small adjacent cells within the
              communication network, each with its own frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
              These crystals could be broken down to smaller crystals which then
              could be placed in wands and staffs to draw the magic from the
              towers. Early experiments revealed the crystal's potential to
              enhance communication, but their true power is yet to be fully
              understood.

          <h2>Species, Life, and Death</h2>
          <p>
            Most OS-tans and such could be considered “human” except for a few
            like GENIAC-tan (who is a puppet) and the older mainframes.

          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>
              Humans and developers do exist in the mainframe, but words mostly
              speak of them and are not really seen. Think of them as your
              average citizens on Earth as an example but some of them are
              responsible for the creation of mainframes, OSes and much more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among these humans are higher-ups which are part of the factions.
              They're sorta like the bosses similar to how you have CEOs and
              devs in real life.

          <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">Mainframes</h2>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>
              The mainframes are portrayed as large mechanical machines due to
              the fact most older machines had bits and pieces you could see,
              but they have human forms they can morph into.
            </p>
            <p>
              They were created by humans for helping with tasks and they slowly
              gained the ability to morph into humans so they did not feel out
              of place. When in their human form they have all the skills and
              needs humans require so mainframes can appear as humans with
              super-human powers. Mainframes will look biologically similar to
              human beings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of them may be hesitant to morph into their human forms like
              COLOSSUS who was betrayed after her helpers burned documents about
              her, let alone kept her existence a secret.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a mainframe dies, its mechanical parts are usually stored in
              buildings or places like museums or completely tossed. If they are
              in their human form when this happens, they will immediately
              return back to their mechanical form.

            <p>
              Other characters in this case refers to two other categories that
              aren’t mainframes or something else. These other classes are
              hardware, operating systems, programs, malware and maybe some
              smaller ones.
            </p>

            <h3 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">Hardware</h3>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
              <p>
                Hardware-tans/kuns includes two smaller classes within it
                however it is its own category to group them all together.
                Although mainframes can be considered hardware, they still stay
                in their separate section because of the differences they have
                for their portrayal. The two smaller classes are hardware are
                computer-tans/kuns and phone-tans/kuns. This also includes
                prototype hardware that were never released such as the
                Commodore 65 and iBook G5.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of them are not machines like the mainframes but instead
                are supernatural humans that have been initiated who can do
                “human things” such as eating, drinking human cuisine and
                displaying other human bodily functions but they can also do
                “computer things.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Some examples of non-machiney computer-tans/kuns and
                phone-tans/kuns are The Mainframe’s versions of iPhone 3G-tan,
                Byt-8-kun and MikroMikko 1-tan.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are some characters who are under this category that are
                not really human-like nor machine such as GENIAC-tan who is a
                puppet. It is hard for these characters to die however if they
                do die, they die like normal humans do. They can also live
                longer than most humans due to emulation.

          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>
              When it comes to the setting of my fanon, things get a little
              weird. Once there was no setting at all so the idea of having one
              was a gradual thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I first started working on my fanon before I even knew what a
              fanon was there was no setting beside the fact the Vintage
              Federation was on a floating island. A lot of ideas from this
              period are hard to track down since notes have been lost,
              therefore it is hard to determine whether there was a real setting
              or not for 2018. It wasn’t until 2023 that I decided to think more
              about the setting, a map and such.

              Below is the old Appendix map from perhaps 2019 or something. I
              cannot remember the exact date this is from but note the old
              faction names such as the 3.14 Society, Hidden Onion Organization
              and Vaporwave. These factions no longer exist except for the
              Vaporwave one which may use a new name.

              The only real parts of The Mainframe’s setting were seen in mainly
              1955 from 2020 even though it did not get far. 1955 showed that at
              least a part of the land had snow and showed that OS-tans/kuns
              interacted with humans, let alone worked with them in normal jobs
              as Simon works at well, a bookshop run by humans.

              In 2023 however, I decided to focus on the setting more. It’s sort
              of a combination of a fantasy cyberpunk world and the real world
              but is mainly fantasy.
