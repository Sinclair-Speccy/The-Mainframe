                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The Infinite Loop is a prominent OS-tan faction representing Apple in The Mainframe. As one of the three most influential factions, they have long been regarded as the epitome of glamour and style in the eyes of the general public. However, their relationship with the Windows-tans has become strained with the transition to ARM processors, marking the third architecture switch in Mac-tan history. This move aligns them more closely with the successful iPhone and iPad-tans.</p>
                    <p>In 2019, there were concerns that macOS Catalina-tan, the latest addition to The Infinite Loop, would bring about purges and disruptions. The debut of Catalina-tan was met with apprehension by many. However, it turned out that Catalina was easier to Hackintosh on unsupported Mac models compared to Mojave, easing some of the worries.</p>
                    <p>In late 2019, Rhapsody-tan and the remaining Classic Mac-tans made the decision to leave The Infinite Loop. It's important to note that their departure was unrelated to the actions of macOS Catalina-tan.</p>
                    <p>Throughout its existence, The Infinite Loop has undergone several name changes, reflecting the separate lineages that form the faction: Pre-Macintosh, Classic Mac, PowerPC, Intel, and Silicon. The Pre-Macintosh lineage is based on the Apple I, II and II, while the Classic Mac lineage is based on the System 1 and 9 operating systems. The PowerPC is for the older Mac OS X OSes which were named after big cats. The Intel lineage is based on the Mac OS X operating system, which was powered by Intel processors. The Silicon lineage is based on the macOS operating system, which is now powered by ARM processors.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <h3>The Beginning of a Legend (1976 - 1983)</h3>
    <p>It all runs back to Apple I-tan who was a prankster in her youth before she had any children who also taught as a maths teacher and worked at the Byte Shop. She was also part of the Club of Homebrew Computers; however, she gradually got lonely and decided to have two kids, those being Apple II and III respectively. Apple I-tan's mischievous mindset softened as she grew older, and she found happiness in teaching mathematics and working at the Byte Shop.</p>
    <p>She rose through the ranks of the Club of Homebrew Computers, where she shared her expertise and enthusiasm for computers with other enthusiasts. However, as time passed, Apple I-tan began to feel lonely and longed for company.</p>
    <p>Apple I-tan decided to have two children, Apple II and Apple III, out of a longing for companionship. These two children, who represented the next generation of Apple's technological history, were her pride and delight. Apple I-tan loved and cared for her children.</p>
    <p>Apple II-tan, with her energetic and lively demeanor, immediately became a popular person in the universe of The Mainframe. She revolutionized the personal computer business by introducing color graphics, expandability, and user-friendly features to the Apple range. In contrast, Apple III-kun inherited his mother's careful disposition and concentrated on developing innovative business-oriented features for TIL.</p>
    <p>While Apple I-tan was proud of her children's achievements, she also felt fulfilled seeing them develop and make their own contributions to the world. Her choice to have children not only offered her companionship but also produced a legacy of creativity that would affect the future of The Infinite Loop and The Mainframe as a whole.</p>
    <p>The family's relationship was reinforced by the journeys of Apple I-tan, Apple II-tan, and Apple III-kun, and they became a technological power to be reckoned with. Their united enthusiasm and drive to pushing computing's borders became the foundation of Apple's success and shaped the industry's path for years to come.</p>

    <h3>What a waste of money, send Steve out of here! (1983)</h3>
    <h3>And you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984 (1984 - 1994)</h3>
    <p>Apple II-tan and Apple III-kun continued to make significant contributions to the personal computer industry in the years following their introduction. Apple II-tan remained a popular choice for home users and businesses alike, thanks to its innovative features and ease of use. Apple III-kun, on the other hand, was more focused on the business market, even though he was unreliable.</p>
    <p>In 1984, Prima was born to Lisa, and she was a huge success, helping to solidify Apple's position as a leading player in the personal computer industry.</p>
    <p>The years between 1984 and 1994 were a time of great growth for Apple. The company introduced a number of new products, including the Macintosh II, the PowerBook, and the LaserWriter printer. Apple also expanded its international business, becoming a global leader in the personal computer market.</p>

    <h3>Welcome to Chicago (1995 - Late 1996)</h3>
    <p>The arrival of Windows 95-tan marked a significant turning point for Apple. With its user-friendly interface and widespread compatibility, Windows 95-tan quickly gained dominance in the market. This shift in the industry made the Apple-tans nervous, as they faced the challenge of competing against the growing popularity of the Windows operating system. The Mac-tans realized the need to adapt and innovate to regain their position.</p>
    <p>During this period, The Infinite Loop had already been part of the AIM Alliance with Motorola and The Blue Gene Collective, so they tried to take advantage of the situation by introducing the Power Macintosh series and Mac OS 7.5. The company aimed to provide users with a more powerful and reliable computing experience. However, the rise of Windows 95-tan posed a formidable challenge, and Apple had to work harder to regain market share and retain its dedicated user base.</p>
    <p>However, by this year a downturn had already begun. The clone program [1] ended up being terminated.</p>

    <h3>The NeXT Solution (1997)</h3>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Except for Mac OS X 10.0 and 10.1, the OS X Cat designs used are the ones drawn by <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/276388">佐登</a>. It is never specified if these designs had distinct personalities so they are expanded on in this fanon.</li>
        <li>Mac OS 9 and KanjiTalk 7.5's designs are the same in this fanon although KanjiTalk 7.5 is instead known as Macintosh System 7.5, noting that KanjiTalk 7.5 was released in January 1995, followed by updates nearly in sync with the release of System 7.5.</li>
        <li>Most Mac versions beyond Catalina do not have a character as it is tedious to make new designs for when Apple releases a new version each year. The same can be applied to the iPhones and iPads where there are no characters beyond the iPhone 11. Characters may end up being made eventually but in this current state, no.</li>
        <li>Some designs such as Yosemite/El Capitan use adapted designs from <a href="https://operatingsuperstars.wordpress.com/">Operating Superstars</a> with permission.</li>
    </ul>
