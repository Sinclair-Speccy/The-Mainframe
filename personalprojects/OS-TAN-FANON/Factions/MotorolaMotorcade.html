            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Despite Motorola DynaTAC-tan being known as the founder by many
              outsiders, everyone within the Motorola Motorcade knows that
              Motorola Research Line Car Radio-kun could be considered the
              "true" leader of the faction. It used to be one of the more
              prominent factions along with the Nokian Liittovaltio until its
              demise. It represents the original Motorola, Inc. that was
              formally known as Galvin Manufacturing Corporation until Motorola,
              Inc. went defunct in 2011. The newer faction represents Motorola
              Mobility and Motorola Solutions however it is part of the Open
              Handset Consortium.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>Before the 1970s</h3>
            <p>
              Before the 1970s, the Motorola Motorcade was a diverse faction
              consisting of entities such as Motorola Research Line Car
              Radio-kun, other car phones and humans. They were pioneers in the
              field of mobile communications, producing mobile telephones that
              were installed in cars and connected to two-way radios to the
              landline telephone system although they also invested in other
              technologies such as radios, cable television and pagers.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the popularity of these car phones grew, so did the challenges.
              The limited number of available frequencies led to long waits for
              connections, and the high-powered base stations caused
              interference, disrupting the quality of communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Motorola Motorcade discovered a new type of crystal that could
              solve these problems. This new type of crystal, which they
              referred to as “Cellular”, was a game-changer. They were large
              crystals and putting them into metal towers allowed for the
              creation of small adjacent cells within the communication network,
              each with its own frequency. This meant that many more car phones
              could be used at one time without causing interference or long
              waits for connections. The origin and concept of these magical
              crystals was proposed by Alliance of Telecommunication Titan
              (AT&T) years earlier and helped the Motorola Motorcade with plans
              for high-capacity mobile telephone systems based on these crystals
              by the early 1970s.
            </p>
            <p>
              To support this new discovery, the Motorola Motorcade developed a
              network of cell sites. These sites, strategically placed
              throughout the faction and its ally factions, supported the
              call-switching infrastructure. This infrastructure was designed to
              track users as they moved through the network, automatically
              switching their calls from one cell to another as their location
              changed. This ensured seamless communication, regardless of the
              user’s movement.
            </p>
            <p>
              They also invested in other discoveries such as helping humans get
              to the moon with transceivers.
