                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The Windows Order is a prominent OS-tan faction. Originally known as DOS Elite, The Windows Order held a position of great influence and wealth, ranking among the top three most influential factions in The Mainframe. However, their supremacy gradually declined due to their inability to enter the smartphone and tablet markets during the late 2000s and early 2010s.</p>
                    <p>One significant turning point for The Windows Order came with the emergence of the Windows 10-tans, spearheaded by Threshold-tan. With her arrival in 2015, she unintentionally drove away the Windows-tans whose support had dwindled over time. This event marked a shift within the faction.</p>
                    <p>The Windows Order is divided into two lineages: 9x and NT. The 9x lineage is based on the original Windows 9x operating system, while the NT lineage is based on the Windows NT operating system. The two lineages have different cultures and traditions.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <h3>The Genesis of The Windows Order (1975 - 1984)</h3>
    <p>The story of The Windows Order begins in the early days of The Mainframe's history.</p>
    <p>During this era, influential figures emerged: Altair-tan, who represents both the Altair 8800 & Altair BASIC, and XENIX, symbolizing Microsoft's version of UNIX. These entities, being pioneers, played significant roles as guiding forces within The Mainframe.</p>
    <p>Altair-tan can be seen as a past member of this faction. During those early days, she did not belong to any specific faction, except for occasional interactions with the Retrograde Conglomerate, a distant entity that existed in the future.</p>
    <p>It was also during this formative period that two significant figures, MS-DOS-kun and PC-DOS-kun, emerged. MS-DOS-kun, personifying MS-DOS, was the twin brother of PC-DOS-kun, who was from the Blue Gene Collective. Together, they symbolized the unique partnership between Microsoft and IBM during this era.</p>
    <p>DOS Elite, as they were known then, was not just a singular faction; they were part of a joint faction with the Blue Gene Collective. This collaboration represented the convergence of Microsoft's and IBM's efforts to establish a standard operating system for personal computing. This alliance was the cornerstone upon which DOS Elite built its influence within The Mainframe.</p>
    <p>As DOS Elite's power grew, they became synonymous with the development and propagation of DOS-based operating systems, setting the stage for their eventual evolution into The Windows Order.</p>

    <h3>Start up the Interface Manager (1985 - 1992)</h3>
    <p>In the mid-'80s, a pivotal moment unfolded within the digital realm known as The Mainframe, marking the inception of The Windows Order's extraordinary journey. The emergence of Windows 1.0-tan in 1985 signified a watershed moment. However, behind the scenes of this burgeoning era, significant shifts were occurring in the partnership between The Windows Order's precursor, DOS Elite, and the Blue Gene Collective, symbolizing IBM. This partnership had been pivotal in the development of early PC operating systems.</p>
    <p>On May 22, 1990, a monumental milestone was reached when The Windows Order, under the banner of Windows 3.x-kun , launched a revolutionary version of its operating system.</p>
    <p>The success of Windows 3.X-kun eclipsed that of OS/2-kun, prompting The Windows Order to shift its resources and commitment more decisively towards itself. Amid this monumental shift, The Windows Order continued to flourish.</p>
    <p>Throughout this transformative era, The Windows Order demonstrated not only resilience but also adaptability, positioning itself as a formidable force within The Mainframe.</p>

    <h3>Navigating Challenges (1992 - 2015)</h3>
    <p>As the digital '90s gave way to the 2000s, The Windows Order confronted a new frontier of challenges. While Windows 95-tan and Windows 98-kun garnered praise, the faction grappled with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle: the shift towards portable computing devices. These emerging markets remained elusive, resulting in a gradual decline of their once-unassailable influence.</p>
    <p>In response to this, The Windows Order underwent a profound internal metamorphosis. They divided into two distinct lineages: the esteemed 9x lineage, helmed by Windows 95-tan and Windows 98-tan, rooted in the original Windows 9x, and the visionary NT lineage, led by Windows NT-kun and Windows 2000-kun.</p>
    <p>In 2015, a momentous turning point arrived with the advent of the enigmatic Windows 10-tans, led by Threshold-tan. Her arrival stirred the very essence of The Windows Order. Her innovative vision inadvertently catalyzed the departure of the waning Windows-tans who had once been steadfast supporters.</p>
    <p>This schism mirrored the broader divide within the faction. The 9x lineage cherished nostalgia and simplicity, drawing strength from the foundations of personal computing. In contrast, the NT lineage, brimming with curiosity, ardently explored new horizons in the ever-evolving realm of technology.</p>

                    <h2>Notes</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Although Microsoft was founded in 1975, it did not release Windows during that time. Instead, it focused on developing products such as Altair BASIC and XENIX. Altair-tan, who also represents Altair BASIC, can be seen as a past member but did not belong to any faction at that time (except for the Retrograde Conglomerate, which existed in the future). Similarly, XENIX can be considered a past member as it was Microsoft's version of UNIX that gained popularity. XENIX is associated with both the UNIX faction and the combination faction, which incorporated The Blue Gene Collective and DOS Elite.</li>
