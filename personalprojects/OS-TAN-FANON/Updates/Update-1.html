			<p>Soo... you may be wondering what is this new section all about and such for my site. Long story short, it's for my OS-tan fanon. The "long" story however...</p>
			
            <section>
                <h2>1 - Now what?</h2>
                <p>A long while after, I ended up no longer being an admin at OS-tans.moe wiki and forums. Some may say this was because of what I did beforehand but it's not. To me, it is a mixture of a misunderstanding and "maybe I shouldn't be a mod". However sometime after when I did do the bad stuff I asked myself if I really should've been staff there in the first place. Writing this isn't so easy because I have to be careful with what I say, and hope I don't say too much.</p>
				<p>Do I hate the owner of OS-tans.moe? No, they did a good thing. Yet at times, I do feel like communication got confusing and the original tone of messages got lost over my DMs with the owner of OS-tans.moe on Discord. As I waited for next year and such I ended up coming to the conclusion that I should step away a bit from being part of a "bigger community". Being part of "larger" communities seems to lead to problems for me.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
    <h2>2 - The next year</h2>
    <p>Now that it is 2024, I decided to plan out how I was going to leave. It wasn't easy. I wanted to leave the Discord server and the subreddit I had as a whole too but ended up deciding to rework the server back to the server for the r/OStan subreddit. This decision wasn't easy and required a lot of thinking from myself personally to look it all over. Initially, I considered leaving the server and subreddit as a whole on the 1st of June as by that time it would’ve been the middle of the year. It was either stay and potentially tarnish the reputation of this place more due to issues I’d rather move on from, or move away and hope the place can thrive without me. After much consideration, I've chosen the newer idea I came up with which is what I mentioned before so I can leave stuff in the past and move on.</p>
    <p>I planned on executing this plan on the 1st of February but got too impatient and executed it on the 25th of January. I was met with a DM quickly after from the owner about whenever we were on good terms. I was nervous, as I thought this was going to be the end so we talked some things out, and I guess it went okay. I was told that someone who I used to talk to but scared away accidentally because of my issues that they were shocked I was pulling all my content from the wiki, but I still find it hard to believe because if they truly disliked me or hated me, they would've ignored my stuff and not even look at it in the first place.</p>
				<p>The outcome resulted in my fanon and stuff about my fanon to be wiped from OS-tans.moe and their forums as the Moeverse took its place in a way with being an umbrella for OS-tans.moe and its two sister projects.</p>

                <h2>3 - What's next?</h2>
                <p>I didn't want to give up completely on my hard work I did on my fanon so before all my stuff was wiped from the wiki, I used wget to copy it all. At first, I planned on hosting my site on Wordpress but the limitations kept annoying me. It didn't display right on mobile no matter what I tried, but at the time using Wordpress seemed like the only solution. It wasn't until that I got all of the pages done on Wordpress that I realised I could put the content on my own site. This meant I could at least style it how I want it to be without being restricted by Wordpress's themes, and I could mimic the style of a wiki without having to run software like MediaWiki.</p>
							<p>As I look back on the way OS-tans.moe was with its rules and guidelines, my fanon began to drift away from having just "OS-tans/kuns" and more of "oh this would look cool as like a mecha or a giant creature!". You see, each sister project for the Moeverse has its own set of admissible articles about what could and could not be added to their wikis. When I first discovered OS-tans I often saw that characters for computers get classed as OS-tans as well under a section called "Other OS-tans". Some of the characters there weren't actual OSes but rather personfications of computer hardware, an example including the MITS Altair 8800 which did not come with an OS, or at least the the initial version of the Altair 8800 did not have an operating system. The -tan for Altair 8800 was for the computer only so I often saw hardware and such falling under the came category.</p>
							<p>When OS-tans.moe was first made I don't think there was much care but as time went on, no one said to me "hey you gotta remove x character because they aren't an *OS*". The wiki only allowed moe personification of an operating system but I had a character for the iPhone 3G/3GS which is a phone, and a character for the MikroMikko which is a computer. There is also a "character" for the original PS1 which is a giant serpent who is more recent but this would most certainly not be admissible at OS-tans.moe, nor Gijinkas.moe as they only really allow personifications that can be associated with the feeling of moe. Moe anthropomorphism is usually seen as making something a cute anime girl or boy so a giant serpent wouldn't really be welcome anywhere.</p>
							<p>With me moving away a bit, I don't have to be bound by these restrictions. So far I have most pages ready but I need to port over the rest of the character pages from Wordpress and convert them along with the remaining lists...</p>
