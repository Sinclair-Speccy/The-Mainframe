        <section>
               <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">What are your thoughts on OS-tans and the fandom?</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>Personally... I think the western side is a mess.</p>
            <p>There is a lot I could say about it but to keep things blunt:</p>
<p>After being at 3 OS-tan communities (or related) they all had their flaws and issues. If you can look past the old Deja Vu vs Futaba drama, taking inspiration from others seems to be common in some parts of the fandom, moreso the western side. In the Trouble Windows fan book you will see that characters like 95-tan is simply someone taking other concepts for 95-tans and combining them into one character. OS-tan Collection's Windows 1.0-tan and PC-DOS-tan are inspired by an early Windows 1.0-tan from 2006 from Futaba (more info on my other OS-tan wiki about this) and XP Kaki-Aki's MS-DOS-tan and my fanon uses older designs from Operating Superstars.</p>

<p>Juzo-kun's design for <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/juzo-kun/art/OS-tan-fanart-Linux-tan-15714339">their Linux-tan</a> (the geared helmet and spear) are references to the earlier human <a href="https://www.ostan-collections.net/gallery/galleries/OS-tans/Linux/Linu1173659558083.jpg">Futaba design</a>, in which subsequent Linux personifications are either based on (or incorporate) features from Juzo-kun's Linux-tan.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ostan-collections.net/gallery/_data/i/galleries/Members_Contributions/C-Chan/Scrap_Art/Chibi_Linux-tan_-_ChibiLinux-tan-me.png">C-Chan's Linux-tan</a> is a combination of both Juzo-kun's and Futaba's Linux-tan. For the Fuataba part, she is depicted with hime-cut hair, a blue and gold billed-and-horned helmet, and ribbon-covered spear; however, she is wearing an outfit based on Juzo-kun's characterization with a modified color scheme.</p>
        
        <p>Besides PC-DOS and the Annex 1.0-tan it seems that inspiration is part of the Western part of the fandom since OS-tan Collections was created as these deisgns came from there.</p>

<p>Inspiration seems to be a core part of what made the Western fandom the way it is. Don't feel like you aren't allowed to use other designs for inspiration as there should be no shame in being inspired by OS-tans, even making them derivatives for jokes and such, but always ask for permission possible if you can contact the person, giving them credit :).</p>

                   <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">Why does your fanon not have artwork?</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>I am more of a writer than an actual artist. In some fandom spaces, writing without drawings is underappreciated :/</p>

        <section>
             <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">What are your thoughts on copyright with OS-tans?</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
			<p>Ehhh... copyright in regards to OS-tans is a touchy subject to me because of my personal views on copyright in general.</p>
<p>The next few lines should be taken with a grain of salt, nor do I condone some things.</p>
<p>You see back in the day you had DejaVu trying to claim ownership of the Futaba OS-tans which led to Me-tan and XP Pro-tan's creators making copyright for their characters respectfully. This mess happened years ago in the 2000s and has since passed on. You also have the Madobe OS-tan copyright from around 2013.</p>
<p>While you should respect the copyright of the creators you still see people out there selling OS-tan stuff on sites like Etsy and RedBubble and making nsfw artworks. This is the case with almost anything else like Touhou and other fandoms. It is sometimes phrased as if these creators will chase after you when that is not the case, at least to me. ME-tan and XP-tan's creators don't seem active anymore and Windows Navi+ isn't around anymore so while the copyright still applies, are they really going to bash you for it?</p>
