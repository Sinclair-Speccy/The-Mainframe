                <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">What are your thoughts on OS-tans and the fandom?
                </h2>
                <div class="dropdown-content">
                    <p>Personally... I think the western side is a mess.</p>

    <p>There is a lot I could say about it but I'm trying to keep it blunt. This will be long too so I suggest you make sure you are comfy:</p>

    <p>A while ago I was looking for more sources and references on OS-tans so I could work on the personal wiki based on my own research. Amongst the results I got there was this blog called "oresama2chan’s diary". I didn't think much of it until I translated the section that first appeared called "How was the OS daughter born Summary".</p>

    <p>Here, I realised the blog shared some of the same thoughts as me in regards to OS-tans, their use and who owns them. However there was one thing that caught my attention on that blog, that being this:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"There are no rules about these types of characters, no general rules for spontaneous net characters, and no rules to protect."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When you think of OS-tans, you probably picture the "main cast" like XP-tan, 95-tan, Me-tan, and 2K-tan. These are the "canon" characters most fans admire. However, after engaging with three OS-tan communities, I found that there are significant issues with how information and research are presented.</p>

    <p>OS-tans, or "OS-musume" (a term used within Futaba), are moe personifications of operating systems, primarily Windows. They originated on Futaba's Nijiura board. This board is known for its chaotic yet collaborative nature, allowing images to be freely used, modified, and transformed. This collaborative spirit has led to the evolution of OS-tans.</p>

    <h2>The Process of Creation:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Origins:</strong> OS-tans started on the Nijiura board, where images and ideas were shared and evolved collaboratively.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Involvement:</strong> Artists, craftsmen, and anonymous members all contributed to the creation and development of OS-tans.</li>
        <li><strong>Principle of E&E:</strong> "Enjoyable and Exciting" interactions drive the community, leading to the organic growth of characters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Points:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaborative Effort:</strong> No single person created OS-tans; it was a collective effort involving many contributors. While you do have creators like Me Aki and NAC (who made XP-tan), this still applies.</li>
        <li><strong>Evolving Characters:</strong> OS-tans were shaped and refined by ongoing community input and collaboration.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Context:</strong> The chaotic nature of the Nijiura board fostered this creative process.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In summary, OS-tans are the result of a community-driven process where many people contributed to their development. The involvement of various artists and craftsmen, combined with the unstructured yet collaborative nature of Nijiura, has shaped these characters into what they are today. Let alone there are no rules such as what counts as an OS-tan and how the term OS-tan should be used...</p>
                    
                    <p>What I should note though is that the blog states everything may not be correct, but this more of applies to information about copyright so it shouldn't matter.</p>

                <div class="dropdown-content">
                    <p>I am more of a writer than an actual artist. In some fandom spaces, writing without drawings is
                        underappreciated :/</p>

                <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">What are your thoughts on copyright with OS-tans?
                </h2>
                <div class="dropdown-content">
                    <p>Ehhh... copyright in regards to OS-tans is a touchy subject to me because of my personal views on
                        copyright in general.</p>
                    <p>The next few lines should be taken with a grain of salt, nor do I condone some things.</p>
                    <p>You see back in the day you had DejaVu trying to claim ownership of the Futaba OS-tans which led
                        to Me-tan and XP Pro-tan's creators making copyright for their characters respectfully. This
                        mess happened years ago in the 2000s and has since passed on. You also have the Madobe OS-tan
                        copyright from around 2013.</p>
                    <p>While you should respect the copyright of the creators you still see people out there selling
                        OS-tan stuff on sites like Etsy and RedBubble and making nsfw artworks. This is the case with
                        almost anything else like Touhou and other fandoms. It is sometimes phrased as if these creators
                        will chase after you when that is not the case, at least to me. ME-tan and XP-tan's creators
                        don't seem active anymore and Windows Navi+ isn't around anymore so while the copyright still
                        applies, are they really going to bash you for it?</p>
