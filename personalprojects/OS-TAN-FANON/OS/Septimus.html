            <h3>Windows Vista</h3>
            <p>Septimus's relationship with Windows Vista-tan can be seen as a journey of growth and improvement. He carefully observed and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of his predecessor, striving to overcome the challenges faced by Windows Vista-tan. Septimus's goal was to provide a more stable, efficient, and user-friendly operating system. He learned from the mistakes made by his predecessor and focused on delivering a more refined and reliable experience. Septimus acknowledges the efforts made by Windows Vista-tan in pushing the boundaries of visual aesthetics and introducing new features. He appreciates the ambition and creativity displayed by Windows Vista-tan, recognizing her role. Despite him being encouraging to her, Vista has resentment over feeling like she is being overshadowed by her younger brother.</p>
            
            <h3>Windows XP</h3>
            <p>Septimus, with his composed nature and strict adherence to protocols and standards, finds himself at odds with Felix's more carefree and sometimes clumsy personality.
