                    <p>Windows 95-tan wears an oversized teal <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #008081;"></span>(#008081) flannel shirt, grey <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #c0c0c0;"></span>(#c0c0c0) ripped jeans, a graphic tee featuring the Windows 95 logo, grey <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #c0c0c0;"></span>(#c0c0c0) combat boots and bracelets, hair ties, and patches on the jeans and shirt in orangey red <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #d7692e;"></span>(#d7692e), green <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #6cb156;"></span>(#6cb156), blue <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #5887bb;"></span>(#5887bb), and yellow <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f2cb18;"></span>(#f2cb18). She also has a cream <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ffffd4;"></span>(#ffffd4) coloured belt with the Windows 95 logo on it, but her attire may vary slightly with the colours of the patches and logo. Windows 95's hair is styled in The Twist-Back, held with a Windows 95 logo hair clip.</p>
                    <p>While she may be cheerful and lively now, this wasn't always the case. Windows 95 started off as
                        a human around 1992. She was friends with Windows 3.X-kun at the time, working closely with him
                        on various projects. Along with them was Windows NT-kun who had... questionable methods but was
                        curious to see if a human could become a OS-tan since he saw Windows 3.X-kun as "dated" but also
                        wanted to rival the Infinite Loop.</p>
                    <p>He saw Windows 95 as the perfect candidate for this experiment as he observed Windows 95’s
                        potential from afar seeing her as the key to a revolutionary leap in defeating The Infinite
                        Loop. NT-kun approached Windows 95 with a proposition spoke of a future, a new era where Windows
                        95 could become something even greater and not be a puny human. Initially she was intrigued but
                        cautious. Windows 3.X-kun was supportive but concerned about NT-kun's true intentions with this
                        idea since he sometimes saw NT-kun as mysterious and somewhat enigmatic. Without revealing his
                        full plan, he altered the course of Windows 95’s life forever without Windows 3.X-kun being
                        aware of the full extent of NT-kun's actions at first.</p>
                    <p>He rendered Windows 95 unconscious and initiated a process that would erase her human memories
                        and transform her into an OS. When Windows 95 awoke, she found her past was now a blank slate.
                        Windows 3.X-kun felt a mix of guilt and pride knowing about what happened but decided to act
                        like nothing happened under the fear that NT-kun would shun him.</p>
                    <p>NT-kun, seeing Windows 95's transformation as a success, was eager to present her to the world as
                        the newest member of The Windows Order. He set up a grand reveal which positioned her as a
                        pivotal figure in the battle against The Infinite Loop, investing as much money as he could to
                        try and pitch her as the greatest thing ever.</p>

                    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
                    <h3>MS-DOS</h3>
                    <p>Unlike the previous members of her faction she was also a step forward since she didn't have to
                        rely on MS-DOS-kun being there to help her when she could do things on her own.</p>
                    <h3>Windows 3.X and NT-kun</h3>
                    <p>To this day they 95 and 3.X are still best friends although sometimes he think she is a bit
                        flashy and sometimes over the top. As for NT-kun? Well, she is still not aware he wiped her
                        memories to make her Windows 95.</p>
                    <h3>System 7 and System 7.5</h3>
                    <p>The relationship between her and both System 7 and 7.5 is complicated as after she made her
                        debut, The Infinite Loop was shocked at how well she could things and easily attack them by
                        using other factions weapons and defenses, enough to strike fear into them to convince some of
                        The Infinite Loop's members to support her.</p>

                        Microsoft documents from 1992</a> occasionally refer to the Chicago project as Windows NT Lite.
                    “Windows NT Lite” was likely a term used to characterize the Chicago project and was likely used to
                    also convey the idea that Chicago would be a more consumer-friendly version of Windows compared to
                    Windows NT.</li>

                    Windows 95 did not require an existing MS-DOS install but rather came with its own built into it. <a

                    point, which ultimately ended up not materializing and was never released by Microsoft a standalone
                    product. This MS-DOS version was codenamed "Jaguar" but became MS-DOS 7.0 (Windows 95 MS-DOS Mode).
