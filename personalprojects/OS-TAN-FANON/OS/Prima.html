            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Macintosh System 1, also known as Prima McIntosh, is one of the triplets along with her siblings Macintosh System 2 and Macintosh System 3. She shares similarities in terms of eye color and hair color with her siblings.</p>
            <p>Prima's attire consists of a grey minidress with black bike shorts, with leg warmers and a wavy-side ponytail hairstyle. While Prima's mischievous nature can occasionally lead to disruptions her intentions are typically harmless and driven by a desire to bring excitement and fun. At time she can get fussy and crash, literally.</p>
            <p>She has trouble getting to sleep unlike her siblings, could only do one thing at a time (and usually took forever doing stuff like disk copying and disk swapping), likes to clean up stuff and would write notes on what she would like to do after waking up. Her favorite games are mazes and puzzles.</p>

            <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
            <h3>Macintosh System 2 & 3</h3>
            <p>Prima shares a close bond with her siblings Macintosh System 2 and Macintosh System 3. While Prima is known for her energetic nature, Macintosh System 2 is more shy while Macintosh System 3 possesses exceptional memory skills.</p>

            <h3>Apple Lisa & XENIX</h3>
            <p>Prima and her siblings are the children of Apple Lisa, and they share a positive relationship with their mother. The higherups attempted to distance them from Lisa. She is also aware of XENIX-tan due to her being friends with Lisa-tan.</p>

            <h3>Wilma</h3>
            <p>Initially Prima held a negative perception of Wilma, viewing her as a threat to the faction. She expressed her concerns openly, often displaying rudeness and dismissiveness towards Wilma. Prima went as far as labeling it a "cheap imitation" and a "waste of space." However Fuji McIntosh, intervened and urged Prima to show more respect and understanding towards Wilma.</p>

            <h3>XEROX Alto</h3>
            <p>Prima and her siblings have a complex relationship with their father, XEROX Alto-kun. XEROX Alto left Lisa when the triplets were young, resulting in limited interaction and knowledge about their father. Prima maintains a distant connection with XEROX Alto and rarely encounters him. The siblings' true encounter with their father occurred when he attempted to sue Lisa for custody of the triplets. Ultimately, Lisa retained custody, and XEROX Alto was ordered to provide child support.</p>

        <li>Her liking puzzles and mazes is a reference to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFrS1K4Wcyc&t=51s">maze program</a> on the pre-release that was a demo on the OG Mac in 1983. The puzzle comes from the <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Mac_System_Software_1.0_Finder_0.85#/media/File:Mss10085puzzle.png">Guided Tour disk</a>.</li>

		        <li>The Shutdown command was not added until <a href="https://lowendmac.com/2005/innovative-macintosh-system-1-0/">System 2.</a> When you were done with your computer, you just switched it off under System 1. This could sometimes result in file corruption, which prompted Apple to add the Shutdown command to System 2.</li>

		<li>Prima having a sledgehammer is a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_(advertisement)">1984 advertisement as the woman in the advert throws a sledgehammer at the screen Big Brother is on, breaking it.</a></li>

<li>Her getting fussy at times and crashing literally is a reference to how the tutorial disk and actual release of System 1 had <a href="https://archive.org/details/mac_Macworld_Mac_Secrets_5th_Edition_1999/page/n329/mode/2up?view=theater">different System and Finder versions. Trying to use the guided tour disk as an actual OS would result in the System crashing.</a> There was a patched version of the System that had to be included with the tutorial disk to avoid crashing.</li>
