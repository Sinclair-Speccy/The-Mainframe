            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Macintosh System 1, also known as Prima McIntosh, is one of the triplets along with her siblings Macintosh System 2 and Macintosh System 3. She shares similarities in terms of eye color and hair color with her siblings, reflecting their familial bond. Prima has a distinctive style and attire, often seen wearing a grey minidress with bike shorts, complemented by leg warmers. She prefers a wavy-side ponytail hairstyle, adding a touch to her appearance. While Prima's mischievous nature can occasionally lead to disruptions, her intentions are typically harmless and driven by a desire to bring excitement and fun. Prima can be a bit impulsive and reckless at times. She sometimes acts before she thinks, and she can get herself into trouble. She can also be a bit bossy and demanding, and she sometimes doesn't listen to others. Her favorite games are mazes and puzzles.</p>

            <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
            <h3>Macintosh System 2 & 3</h3>
            <p>Prima shares a close bond with her siblings, Macintosh System 2 and Macintosh System 3. While Prima is known for her energetic nature, Macintosh System 2, also known as Fuji McIntosh, is more passive. Macintosh System 3, also known as Saburo McIntosh, possesses exceptional memory skills. Despite their contrasting traits, the triplets maintain a strong sibling connection, supporting and understanding each other's unique qualities.</p>

            <h3>Apple Lisa</h3>
            <p>Prima and her siblings are the children of Apple Lisa, and they share a positive relationship with their mother. Although developers attempted to distance them from Lisa's legacy, Prima, Fuji, and Saburo acknowledge and appreciate their mother's contribution to computing. Lisa-tan takes pride in her children's accomplishments and supports their endeavors wholeheartedly.</p>

            <h3>Windows 1.0</h3>
            <p>Initially, Prima held a negative perception of Windows 1.0, viewing it as a threat to the Macintosh. She expressed her concerns openly, often displaying rudeness and dismissiveness towards Windows 1.0. Prima went as far as labeling it a "cheap imitation" and a "waste of space." However, her brother, Fuji McIntosh, intervened and urged Prima to show more respect and understanding towards Windows 1.0. Over time, Prima realized the importance of acknowledging the strengths of other operating systems, leading to a shift in her attitude towards Windows 1.0.</p>

            <h3>XEROX Alto</h3>
            <p>Prima and her siblings have a complex relationship with their father, XEROX Alto-kun. XEROX Alto left Lisa when the triplets were young, resulting in limited interaction and knowledge about their father. Prima, Macintosh System 1, maintains a distant connection with XEROX Alto and rarely encounters him. The siblings' true encounter with their father occurred when he attempted to sue Lisa for custody of the triplets. Ultimately, Lisa retained custody, and XEROX Alto was ordered to provide child support.</p>

            <h3>XENIX</h3>
            <p>Prima, as Macintosh System 1, is aware of XENIX-tan due to her connection with Lisa-tan. They recognize each other's existence.</p>

            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>Prima's abilities are limited as the OS itself was limited. She can usually only do one thing at a time, cannot multitask, and has trouble going to sleep by herself. However, she does have a large sledgehammer.</p>
