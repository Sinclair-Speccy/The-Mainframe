                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Stella is a dark-skinned and elegant character and formal besides OS X Lion-tan. Her outfit
                        consists of a sleek, knee-length dress that is primarily dark blue and light blue. The bodice of
                        her dress is dark blue with grey brushed-metal paneling along the sides, while the skirt is
                        light blue and A-line along with a brushed-metal belt is around her waist and long dark blue
                        gloves with metallic cuffs. Stella also wears long dark blue tights and boots made up of black,
                        dark blue, and white, a small brushed-metal brooch with a subtle red accent, dark blue hair that
                        flows beyond her hips, orange cat eyes, and both a panther tail and ears where human ears would
                        usually be.</p>
                    <p>Stella is known as being one of of the more formal ones out of the OS X cats in The Infinite
                        Loop. Stella is very skilled in her work as a metal worker as she can craft, repair, and modify
                        various metal objects and devices such as weapons, armor, tools, and jewelry. She is also a
                        calligrapher and has mastered various different types of visual arts with her writing, often
                        organising her calligraphy projects into books in different collections.</p>
                    <p>Although formal, she can be suggestive too but you have to get to know her well enough to
                        experience this. To outsiders, what she does is secretive as she is not open about her life to
                        strangers unless she gets to know them well because she prefers to have a secretive, private
                        life. Despite this she can adapt to different social settings quickly while maintaining her
                        formal demeanor.</p>

                    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
                    <h3>Other OSX Cats</h3>
                    <p>Most of the OS X cats are closely connected with each other however Stella is more close to
                        Leopard/Snow Leopard-tan and Jaguar-tan.</p>

                    <h3>Mavericks-kun</h3>
                    <p>Stella is curious about OS X Mavericks-kun who is not named after a big cat, but after a surfing
                        location in California. She tends to tease him like Mojave teases Mavericks too.</p>
