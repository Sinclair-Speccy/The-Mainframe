            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>
              Windows 3.X-kun is a war veteran who found a new purpose after his
              service. He has two attires based on the two releases of Windows:
              3.0 and 3.1. His casual magician attire consists of a teal blazer,
              a patterned shirt with light gray, white, and beige/yellowish
              colours, black pants with a black and white tophat along with a
              wand. There are also some lilac accessories such as bracelets.
            </p>
            <p>
              His war attire consists of a mainly grey and teal "Class A" army
              service uniform with badges based on the icons and windows logo.
              Around the 90s he was enlisted to fight in the OS wars as much to
              his dismay as tries to be passive and friendly to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>Both of his attires consist of scruffy grey hair.</p>
            <p>
              Around during his debut he decided to create games for people with
              whatever he had laying around at the time with no proper testing.
              Despite this lack of proper testing his games were a success.
            </p>
            <p>
              In his free time he is often either playing Solitaire, enjoying
              multimedia-centric activities, making teddy bears for kids,
              running his hotdog stand at the Retrograde Conglomerate, putting
              on magic shows for kids and playing other minor games such as
              Minesweeper and Freecell.
            </p>
            <p>
              He also invented his own cipher that was based upon another one.

            <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
            <h3>Windows 95</h3>
            <p>
              Being the predecessor to her he often thought she was too into the
              war stuff at the time due to the OS Wars going on and him not
              really liking the idea of being enlisted in the first place,
              although he does admire her rebelness at times.
            </p>
            <h3>Windows NT</h3>
            <p>
              Windows NT-kun is *sort of* a twin to him but not really. He was
              tasked with training him despite NT being way more advanced than
              him and copying the same clothes he wears... but in slightly
              different colours. How original. Windows 3.X often sees him as too
              advanced to understand him.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>
              As a war veteran he has some tricks up his sleeve such as knowing
              how to use guns, not that he really likes using weapons and would
              rather sort stuff out passively.

              The free time activities are literal programs and eastereggs
              within Windows 3.0 and 3.1 such as Solitaire (page 387 from

              The fact he had to be Windows NT's mentor of sorts is from the
              fact Windows NT 3.1's

              is the exact same to 3.1's desktop but instead in the Windows 95
              colours (the teal and dark blue). Both OSes also share 3.1 in
              their names.

              The games created by him during his debut are based on the

                >Microsoft Entertainment Packs</a
              >
              which were packs of games made by Windows employees that had been
              working on in their spare time. These packs were created
              Microsoft's “Entry Business” team as Microsoft themselves were
              concerned that the operating system’s high hardware requirements
              meant that people would only see it as a tool for large
              enterprises. The project also had almost no budget.

              Him "inventing" his own cipher is based on how the first version
