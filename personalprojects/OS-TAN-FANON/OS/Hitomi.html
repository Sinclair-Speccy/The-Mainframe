                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Macintosh System 1, also known as Hitomi McIntosh, is one of the triplets along with her siblings
                        Macintosh System 2 and Macintosh System 3. She shares similarities in terms of eye color and
                        hair color with her siblings.</p>
<p>
  Hitomi's attire consists of a <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #1f1f1f;"></span> black (#1f1f1f) dress with long sleeves with a <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ffffff;"></span> white (#ffffff) front panel and a <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #1f1f1f;"></span> black (#1f1f1f) bow at the collar, a skirt that flares out with lace trim for decoration, <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #2c2c2c;"></span> dark velvet (#2c2c2c) gloves with <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ffffff;"></span> white (#ffffff) lace edges and <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f5deb3;"></span> beige (#f5deb3) laces for a corset-like look, <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #000000;"></span> black (#000000) shoes with chunky heels, heart-shaped buckles, decorative bows and <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ffffff;"></span> white (#ffffff) lace socks along with a <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #1f1f1f;"></span> black (#1f1f1f) and <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #808080;"></span> grey (#808080) tiara on top of her <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #000000;"></span> long black (#000000) wavy-side hair. While Hitomi's mischievous nature can occasionally lead to disruptions her intentions are typically harmless. At time she can get fussy and crash, literally.
</p>


                    <p>She has trouble getting to sleep unlike her siblings, could only do one thing at a time (and
                        usually took forever doing stuff like disk copying and disk swapping), likes to clean up stuff
                        and would write notes on what she would like to do after waking up. Her favorite games are mazes
                        and puzzles.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
                    <h3>Fuji and Saburo</h3>
                    <p>Hitomi shares a close bond with her siblings Macintosh System 2 and Macintosh System 3. While
                        Hitomi is known for her energetic nature, Macintosh System 2 is more shy while Macintosh System 3
                        possesses exceptional memory skills.</p>

                    <h3>Apple Lisa</h3>
                    <p>Hitomi and her siblings are the children of Apple Lisa, and they share a positive relationship
                        with their mother. The higherups attempted to distance them from Lisa.</p>

                    <h3>Wilma</h3>
                    <p>Initially Hitomi held a negative perception of Wilma, viewing her as a threat to the faction. She
                        expressed her concerns openly, often displaying rudeness and dismissiveness towards Wilma. Hitomi
                        went as far as labeling it a "cheap imitation" and a "waste of space." However Fuji McIntosh,
                        intervened and urged Hitomi to show more respect and understanding towards Wilma.</p>

    <h2>References and sources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_1">Wikipedia entry on System 1.</a></li>

        <li>Her liking puzzles and mazes is a reference to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFrS1K4Wcyc&t=51s">maze program</a> on the pre-release that was a demo on the OG Mac in 1983. The puzzle comes from the <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Mac_System_Software_1.0_Finder_0.85#/media/File:Mss10085puzzle.png">Guided Tour disk</a>.</li>

        <li>The Shutdown command was not added until <a href="https://lowendmac.com/2005/innovative-macintosh-system-1-0/">System 2</a>. When you were done with your computer, you just switched it off under System 1. This could sometimes result in file corruption, which prompted Apple to add the Shutdown command to System 2.</li>

        <li>Hitomi having a sledgehammer is a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_(advertisement)">1984 advertisement</a>, as the woman in the advert throws a sledgehammer at the screen Big Brother is on, breaking it.</li>

        <li>Her getting fussy at times and crashing literally is a reference to how the tutorial disk and actual release of System 1 had <a href="https://archive.org/details/mac_Macworld_Mac_Secrets_5th_Edition_1999/page/n329/mode/2up?view=theater">different System and Finder versions</a>. Trying to use the guided tour disk as an actual OS would result in the System crashing. There was a patched version of the System that had to be included with the tutorial disk to avoid crashing.</li>
