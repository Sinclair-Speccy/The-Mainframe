                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Amadea's design is the exact same as Futaba's KanjiTalk 7.5-tan which is a blue-eyed woman with
                        long blonde hair with a large cowlick and a "7.5" hair clip, a light blue dress, white top,
                        taskbar-style armband, long brown boots and sometimes, fingerless gloves or a scarf. The main
                        different is that she has a different personality that is expanded on more from Futaba's
                        KanjiTalk 7.5-tan.</p>
                    <p>
                        A complicated character, Amadea has been through a complex life ranging from trying to remember
                        what the heck happened during 2019, 2020 and 2021 and getting thrown into a cosmic reset along
                        with other characters that reset their memories. She doesn't remember much from the past besides
                        faint details, like a fight that escalated which had some of her family such as Aldebaran
                        against Jasper Ive, being controlled by an unknown entity and her and Sochi Ive having conflicts
                        that were a leadup to a mess during a time of crisis. She has a disgruntled and stoic demeanor,
                        but can show a caring side.</p>
                    <p>Despite all of this she seems to fare well now such as investing in making robots (in case of a
                        Kaiju attack) but she is a bit scatterbrained too.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
                    <h3>Macintosh System 6-kun</h3>
                    <p>Before the cosmic reset, Aamaeda had a complicated relationship with her older sibling who is not
                        related by blood, Aldebaran, then known as Antares. They used to be close and supportive of each
                        other, but they had a falling out when Amadea left TIL and Aldebaran stayed. Amadea accused
                        Aldebaran of being a tyrant and a traitor, while Aldebaran blamed Amadea for being reckless and
                        selfish. They have not reconciled since then, and they often avoid or confront each other.</p>
                    <p>After the cosmic reset, they got along with each other better, as Antares’s memories were even
                        more forgotten about the situation and he name changed to Aldebaran, along with her gender. He
                        didn’t remember what happened between them. They still have some differences and disagreements,
                        but they also have some respect for each other.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Macintosh System 7-tan</h3>
                    <p>Amadea has a friendly relationship with her older sister. Before the cosmic reset, Pleiades was
                        one of the few OS-tans who understood and respected Amadea’s decision to leave TIL, but she felt
                        obligated to stay and protect their other sisters. Amadea still cares for Pleiades, and she
                        hopes to convince her to join her someday. After the cosmic reset, not much really changed
                        between them besides all this drama with TIL being forgotten.</p>

                    <h3>Mac OS 8-kun</h3>
                    <p>Before the cosmic reset, Allegro was known as Tempo and she had a hostile relationship with
                        Amadea as they were rivals and enemies with different views and goals. Tempo was the leader of
                        the walled garden, a system that restricted and controlled the Macs while Amadea was a wanderer
                        who left due to the Walled Garden destroying or shutting down most of her projects like the Mac
                        Clone project. Tempo despised Amadea for her rebellion and defiance while Amadea hated Tempo for
                        her oppression and manipulation.</p>
                    <p>After the cosmic reset, Tempo became a male, is named Allegro, and wasn’t as aggressive as he
                        didn’t completely agree with the walled garden. Amadea only faintly remembers what happened
                        between her and Tempo, but something in her mind tells her to “make it right this one time”.
                        They still have some tension and distrust, but they also have some common enemies and challenges
                        that force them to cooperate or compromise.</p>

                    <h3>OS/2-kun</h3>
                    <p>Amadea has a mixed relationship with OS/2-kun howver they met during the AIM alliance that was
                        formed in 1991 to create a new computing platform between their factions.</p>
                    <p>Before the cosmic reset, OS/2-kun was a female named Hikari, and was a jerk to Amadea. She made
                        her feel unwelcome and inferior because IBM saw the Macs as weird and useless, and unable or
                        unwilling to conform to IBM standards. She also disliked that Amadea was one of the “bad Macs”.
                    </p>
                    <p>After the cosmic reset, OS/2-kun became a male named Aldrin, and was more friendly to Amadea.
                        They got along during the AIM alliance, as Amadea had mostly blocked out what happened between
                        what happened between her and Hikari in the past.</p>

                    <h3>System V/88-kun</h3>
                    <p>Not much is known about how these two interacted as System V/88-kun briefly joined the AIM
                        alliance, before leaving himself after some complex situations occurred.</p>

                    <h2>Abilities</h2>
                    <p>Amadea wields pistols, and sometimes can dual-wield pistols.</p>

                        7.5.</a></li>

                <li>A lot of Amadea's characterisation comes from another person who expanded on her before I did,
                    exploring more of the OS for Amadea's character. Many of these include ideas such as how 7.5-tan
                    likely calls herself Amadea Pippin <a
                        href="https://cultureofgaming.com/apple-pippin-1996-retrospective/">in reference to the Pippin
                        being meant to be its own line, not unlike the Macintosh</a>, the relationship between them,
                    OS/2, Mac OS 8, and some other ideas.</li>

                <li>Amadea's and Allegro's conflict from the past is a reference to Apple's Mac OS 7 licensing program
                    and the Mac clones. <a
                        href="https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_9205_May_1992/page/n21/mode/2up?view=theater">Apple
                        executives decided to launch an official clone program in order to expand Macintosh market
                        share</a>. However this cut into their own market share. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the
                    clone makers' licenses were valid only for Apple's System 7 operating system, so Apple's release of
                    Mac OS 8 left the clone manufacturers without the ability to ship a current Mac OS version and
                    effectively ended the cloning program.</li>

                <li>Amadea interacting with System V/88 is a reference to the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_88000#Abandonment">Motorola 88000 and Motorola's
                        System V/88</a>. In the early 1990s, Motorola joined the AIM Alliance and incorporated few
                    features of the 88000 (such as a compatible bus interface) into the new PowerPC architecture. At
                    that point, the 88000 was dumped as soon as possible.</li>
