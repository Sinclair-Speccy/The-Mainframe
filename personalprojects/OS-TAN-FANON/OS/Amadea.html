            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Amadea's design is the exact same as Futaba's KanjiTalk 7.5-tan, Kapone, except she has a different personality that is expanded on more from Kapone's and represents the English version of Macintosh System 7.5 (Kapone is the Japanese version). A complicated character, Amadea has been through a complex life ranging from trying to remember what the heck happened during 2019, 2020 and 2021 and getting thrown into a cosmic reset along with other characters that reset their memories. Her last name comes from the Apple Pippin. She doesn't remember much from the past besides faint details, like a fight that escalated which had some of her family like Aldebaran against Jasper Ive, being controlled by an unknown entity and her and Sochi Ive having conflicts that were a leadup to a mess during a time of crisis.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
            <h3>Macintosh System 6-kun</h3>
            <p>Amadea has a complicated relationship with her older sibling who is not related by blood, Aldebaran, then known as Antares. They used to be close and supportive of each other, but they had a falling out when Amadea left TIL and Aldebaran stayed. Amadea accused Aldebaran of being a tyrant and a traitor, while Aldebaran blamed Amadea for being reckless and selfish. They have not reconciled since then, and they often avoid or confront each other. However, their falling out is a blurry memory to Amadea, as it happened before the cosmic reset that changed their timeline and history. After the cosmic reset, they got along with each other better, as Antares’s memories were even more forgotten about the situation and he name chnaged to Aldebaran, along with her gender. He didn’t remember what happened between them. They still have some differences and disagreements, but they also have some respect for each other.</p>

            <h3>Macintosh System 7-tan</h3>
            <p>Amadea has a friendly relationship with her older sister, Pleiades. They share a lot of interests and hobbies, and they often help each other with their tasks. Pleiades was one of the few OS-tans who understood and respected Amadea’s decision to leave TIL, but she felt obligated to stay and protect their other sisters. Amadea still cares for Pleiades, and she hopes to convince her to join her someday. After the cosmic reset, not much really changed between them besides all this drama with TIL being forgotten.</p>

            <h3>Mac OS 8-kun</h3>
            <p>Amadea and Allegro’s relationship is affected by the cosmic reset, an event that occurred in 2021, when a mysterious force erased the memories and histories of many OS-tans and other characters, and created a new timeline with different factions and groups. Before the cosmic reset, Allegro was known as Tempo and she had a hostile relationship with Amadea, as they were rivals and enemies with different views and goals. Tempo was the leader of the walled garden, a system that restricted and controlled the Macs while Amadea was a wanderer who left due to the Walled Garden destroying or shutting down most of her projects, like the Mac Clone project. Tempo despised Amadea for her rebellion and defiance, while Amadea hated Tempo for her oppression and manipulation. However, their conflict is a blurry memory to Amadea, as it happened before the cosmic reset that changed their timeline and history. After the cosmic reset, Tempo became a male, is named Allegro, and wasn’t as aggressive as he didn’t completely agree with the walled garden. Amadea only faintly remembers what happened between her and Tempo, but something in her mind tells her to “make it right this one time”. They still have some tension and distrust, but they also have some common enemies and challenges that force them to cooperate or compromise.</p>

            <h3>OS/2-kun</h3>
            <p>Amadea has a mixed relationship with OS/2-kun. They met during the AIM alliance that was formed in 1991 to create a new computing platform. Before the cosmic reset, OS/2-kun was a female named Hikari, and was a jerk to Amadea. She made her feel unwelcome and inferior because IBM saw the Macs as weird and useless, and unable or unwilling to conform to IBM standards. She also disliked that Amadea was one of the “bad Macs”. However, their relationship is a blurry memory to Amadea, as it happened before the cosmic reset that changed their timeline and history. After the cosmic reset, OS/2-kun became a male named Aldrin, and was more friendly to Amadea. They got along during the AIM alliance, as Amadea had mostly blocked out what happened between what happened between her and Hikari in the past.</p>

            <h3>System V/88-kun</h3>
            <p>Not much is known about how these two interacted as System V/88-kun briefly joined the AIM alliance, before leaving himself after some complex situations occurred.</p>

            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>Amadea wields pistols, and sometimes can dual-wield pistols.</p>
