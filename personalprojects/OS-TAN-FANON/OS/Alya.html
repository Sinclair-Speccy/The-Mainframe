                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Alya wears an oversized teal <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #008081;"></span>(#008081) flannel shirt, grey <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #c0c0c0;"></span>(#c0c0c0) ripped jeans, a graphic tee featuring the Windows 95 logo, grey <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #c0c0c0;"></span>(#c0c0c0) combat boots and bracelets, hair ties, and patches on the jeans and shirt in orangey red <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #d7692e;"></span>(#d7692e), green <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #6cb156;"></span>(#6cb156), blue <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #5887bb;"></span>(#5887bb), and yellow <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f2cb18;"></span>(#f2cb18). She also has a cream <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ffffd4;"></span>(#ffffd4) coloured belt with the Windows 95 logo on it, but her attire may vary slightly with the colours of the patches and logo. Alya's hair is a long, brown hair with pink streaks styled in a high ponytail with a loose, wavy texture with a distinct curl at the end.</p>
                    <p>While she may be cheerful and lively now, this wasn't always the case. Alya started off as
                        a human around 1992. She was friends with Evan at the time, working closely with him
                        on various projects. Along with them was Micron who had... questionable methods but was
                        curious to see if a human could become a OS-tan since he saw Alya as "dated" but also
                    wanted to rival the Infinite Loop.</p>
                    <p>He saw Alya as the perfect candidate for this experiment as he observed Alya’s
                        potential from afar seeing her as the key to a revolutionary leap in defeating The Infinite
                        Loop. Micron approached Alya with a proposition spoke of a future, a new era where Alya could become something even greater and not be a puny human. Initially she was intrigued but
                        cautious. Evan was supportive but concerned about Micron's true intentions with this
                        idea since he sometimes saw Micron as mysterious and somewhat enigmatic. Without revealing his
                        full plan, he altered the course of Alya’s life forever without Evan being
                    aware of the full extent of Micron's actions at first.</p>
                    <p>He rendered Alya unconscious and initiated a process that would erase her human memories
                        and transform her into an OS. When Alya awoke, she found her past was now a blank slate.
                        Evan felt a mix of guilt and pride knowing about what happened but decided to act
                    like nothing happened under the fear that Micron would shun him.</p>
                    <p>Micron, seeing Alya's transformation as a success, was eager to present her to the world as
                        the newest member of The Windows Order. He set up a grand reveal which positioned her as a
                        pivotal figure in the battle against The Infinite Loop, investing as much money as he could to
                    try and pitch her as the greatest thing ever.</p>

                    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
                    <h3>Mason</h3>
                    <p>Unlike the previous members of her faction she was also a step forward since she didn't have to
                        rely on Mason being there to help her when she could do things on her own.</p>
                    <h3>Evan and Micron</h3>
                    <p>To this day Evan and Alya are still best friends although sometimes he think she is a bit
                        flashy and sometimes over the top. As for Micron? Well, she is still not aware he wiped her
                        memories to make her Windows 95.</p>
                    <h3>Jillian/h3>
                    <p>The relationship between her and Jillian is complicated as after she made her
                        debut, The Infinite Loop was shocked at how well she could things and easily attack them by
                        using other factions weapons and defenses, enough to strike fear into them to convince some of
                        The Infinite Loop's members to support her.</p>

                    <h2>Abilities</h2>
                    <p>Whether you consider this an ability or not is up to you but she is very good at using guns,
                        mainly shotguns and mechs.</p>

                    have slightly different coloured boot screens for the Windows logo, mainly the logo on the PC-98
                    version looking more like the one from 3.1 but tilted.</li>
                <li>Windows NT-kun being the one who made Alya an OS-tan is a reference to how <a
                        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210819130851/http://antitrust.slated.org/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/5000/PX05522.pdf">internal
                        Microsoft documents from 1992</a> occasionally refer to the Chicago project as Windows NT Lite.
                    “Windows NT Lite” was likely a term used to characterize the Chicago project and was likely used to
                    also convey the idea that Chicago would be a more consumer-friendly version of Windows compared to
                    Windows NT.</li>
                <li>Windows 3.X-kun being Windows 95's friend is a reference to how the initial design and planning of
                    Windows 95 can be traced back to around <a

                <li>Windows 95 not needing MS-DOS-kun's help is a reference to how unlike previous version of Windows,
                    Windows 95 did not require an existing MS-DOS install but rather came with its own built into it. <a
                        href="http://groklaw.net/pdf/iowa/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/1000/PX01308.pdf"> A
                        standalone retail release</a> for the MS-DOS version used in Windows 95 was also planned at one
                    point, which ultimately ended up not materializing and was never released by Microsoft a standalone
                    product. This MS-DOS version was codenamed "Jaguar" but became MS-DOS 7.0 (Windows 95 MS-DOS Mode).

                        enough</a> that everybody who used Macs because they were easier to use, would then be able to
                    say that Windows was just as easy</li>
