            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Énteka Valsun stands out with his white hair and deep purple eyes compared to the Decimas. He wears a sleek dark blue suit decorated with subtle glowing accents, intricate silver patterns along the suit's seams and translucent wings that fold neatly into his back.</p>
			
			<p>Originally intended to be a Decima that embodied Windows 10X, Énteka Valsun found himself in a difficult situation when the project was abruptly canceled in 2021. This resulted to his decline and fate of becoming an unreleased member of TWO, similar to Neptune and Odyssey, which would have led to his obscurity and irrelevance. Valsun, who was previously associated with innovation, was on the verge of becoming obsolete.</p>
			
			<p>The cancellation raised the possibility that Valsun may suffer the same fate as Neptune and Odyssey, becoming unpublished members lost to The Windows Order's archives. Valsun had the challenging job of redirecting himself within The Windows Order following Windows 10X's cancellation. He had to take immediate action to keep himself from becoming an unreleased member, which was a very real threat.</p>
			
			<p>Valsun took advantage of this pivotal moment to flesh out the idea of Windows 11. In addition to keeping him from possible obscurity, his determination and excellent intelligence placed him in the center of The Windows Order. His strategic vision and relentless motivation caught the attention of the top ranks of The Windows Order when he presented his plan for Windows 11. The higher-ups saw Windows 11's potential as a game-changer for the faction as well as a worthy replacement to Windows 10X.</p>
			
			<p>Valsun's approach was embraced by the higher-ups, who understood that Windows 11 would be needed to stay competitive. With Windows 10 getting older, it was thrilling and appealing to think of bringing in a OS to The Windows Order that could compete with The Infinite Loop.</p>
			
            <p>Valsun's approach to security has earned him a reputation for arrogance that has alienated some humans. His insistence on the most recent hardware including a CPU from the last three years, a TPM security chip and Secure Boot-capable firmware has often come across as elitist. He tends to look down upon those who don't meet these stringent requirements, creating a divide between those who can afford cutting-edge technology and those who cannot. He also tends to dismiss alternative security methods, believing that this is the only foolproof solution. It can also be interpreted as an assertion of superiority of sorts, implying that only those who adhere to his strict security standards are worthy of protection.</p>

			<h3>The Decimas</h3>
            <p>Valsun holds disapproval towards the Decimas as he sees them as resistant to change.</p>
			<h3>Threshold</h3>
			<p>Having faced resistance and skepticism from Decima Threshold and possibly the other Decimas he developed a sense of perceived opposition. His approach to running TWO has fueled a superiority complex, wherein he sees his ideas as superior and more forward-thinking than the established views Threshold made. This perceived superiority contributes to a disdainful attitude towards Threshold and others who may align with her traditionalist perspective.</p>
