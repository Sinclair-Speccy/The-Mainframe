                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Endékatos Valsun has white <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f2f2f2;"></span>(#f2f2f2) hair and deep purple <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #804c9f;"></span>(#804c9f) eyes compared to the Decimas. He wears a sleek dark blue <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #1255b5;"></span>(#1255b5) suit decorated with subtle glowing accents, intricate white <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #eeeeee;"></span>(#eeeeee) patterns along the suit's seams and light blue <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #94b8d2;"></span>(#94b8d2) translucent wings that fold neatly into his back.</p>


                    <p>Originally intended to be a Decima that would have been part of Threshold's species only, Endékatos
                        Valsun found himself in a difficult situation when the project responsible for his creation was
                        abruptly canceled in 2021. This resulted in his decline and fate of becoming an unreleased
                        member of TWO similar to Neptune and Odyssey which would have led to his obscurity and
                        irrelevance. The cancellation raised the possibility that Valsun may suffer the same fate as
                        Neptune and Odyssey, becoming members lost to The Windows Order's archives. He had to take
                        immediate action to keep himself from becoming an unreleased member, which was a very real
                        threat.</p>

                    <p>Valsun took advantage of this moment to flesh out a whole new idea to replace the aging Decimas.
                        In addition to keeping him from possible obscurity, his determination and excellent intelligence
                        placed him in the center of The Windows Order. His strategic vision and relentless motivation
                        caught the attention of the top ranks of The Windows Order when he presented his plan for
                        Windows 11. The higher-ups saw Windows 11's potential as a game-changer for the faction as well
                        as a worthy replacement to Windows 10X. Valsun's approach was embraced by the higher-ups who
                        understood that Windows 10 getting older.</p>

                    <p>Valsun's approach to security has earned him a reputation for arrogance that has alienated some
                        humans. His insistence on the most recent hardware has often come across as elitist. He tends to
                        look down upon those who don't meet these stringent requirements, creating a divide between
                        those who can afford cutting-edge technology and those who cannot. He also tends to dismiss
                        alternative security methods believing that this is the only foolproof solution. It can also be
                        interpreted as an assertion of superiority of sorts implying that only those who adhere to his
                        strict security standards are worthy of protection.</p>

                    <p>His more recent approach is to try and sway more followers to himself by creating an AI...</p>

                    <h3>The Decimas</h3>
                    <p>Having faced resistance and skepticism from Decima Threshold and possibly the other Decimas he
                        developed a sense of perceived opposition. </p>
                    <p>Valsun holds disapproval towards the Decimas as he sees them as resistant to change. His approach
                        to running TWO has fueled a superiority complex wherein he sees his ideas as superior and more
                        forward-thinking than the established views Threshold made. This perceived superiority
                        contributes to a disdainful attitude towards Threshold and others who may align with her
                        traditionalist perspective.</p>
                    <p>Threshold still has stronger forces compared to Valsun.</p>

                <li>Valsun's aggressiveness and elitism comes from a lot of the issues with Windows 11's requirements
                    leading to things such as how <a

                <li>Threshold having stronger forces compared to Valsun is a reference to how <a
                        href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/operating-systems/windows-11-market-share-declines-as-users-seemingly-shift-back-to-windows-10">Windows

                <li>Valsun resorting to AI is a reference to Windows 11 removing Cortana and replacing her with Copilot
                    (and Windows Recall).</li>
