                    <h2>Character</h2>
                   <p>
        Endékatos Valsun has white <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f2f2f2;"></span>(#f2f2f2) short hair with subtle streaks of light blue, deep purple <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #804c9f;"></span>(#804c9f) eyes, and an aura that shimmers faintly like a holographic glow. He wears a sleek pastel periwinkle to cerulean blue <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #7994cb; margin-right: 5px;"></span>
<span class="color-box" style="background-color: #4fa1db;"></span>(#7994cb to #4fa1db) suit with a layered look, featuring intricate white silver <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #eeeeee;"></span>(#eeeeee) flowing patterns along the seams. He also has light blue <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #94b8d2;"></span>(#94b8d2) translucent wings.
    </p>

                    <p>Originally intended to be a Decima that would have been part of Threshold's species only, Endékatos
                        Valsun found himself in a difficult situation when the project responsible for his creation was
                        abruptly canceled in 2021. This resulted in his decline and fate of becoming an unreleased
                        member of TWO similar to Neptune and Odyssey which would have led to his obscurity and
                        irrelevance. The cancellation raised the possibility that Valsun may suffer the same fate as
                        Neptune and Odyssey, becoming members lost to The Windows Order's archives. He had to take
                        immediate action to keep himself from becoming an unreleased member, which was a very real
                        threat.</p>

                    <p>Valsun took advantage of this moment to flesh out a whole new idea to replace the aging Decimas.
                        In addition to keeping him from possible obscurity, his determination and excellent intelligence
                        placed him in the center of The Windows Order. His strategic vision and relentless motivation
                        caught the attention of the top ranks of The Windows Order when he presented his plan for
                        Windows 11. The higher-ups saw Windows 11's potential as a game-changer for the faction as well
                        as a worthy replacement to Windows 10X. Valsun's approach was embraced by the higher-ups who
                        understood that Windows 10 getting older.</p>

                    <p>Valsun’s strict security methods are often seen as overly confident and his fixation on the latest hardware can come off as a bit elitist. He tends to dismiss alternatives, convinced that only his approach is foolproof which sometimes creates a divide between those who can afford top-tier technology and those who cannot. While his uncompromising standards might be interpreted as an air of superiority, it is more like a case of him rushing into extreme measures without fully weighing all the options.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite thinking he is better than the older members of TWO, he does have some hidden appreciation for the older Windows characters and isn't all that evil as others framed him as... only to have a bit of a high ego</p>
                    
                    <p>Valsun doesn't adhere to human gender norms either. For him, masculinity is simply the most logical way to project strength as it's not an instinct. When people label him "Femsun" he defends himself not because he understands the term, but because it makes no sense in his brain. He can't understand why humans see him as feminine and that only adds to his frustration.</p>

                    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
                    <h3>The Decimaes</h3>
                    <p>Valsun once had strong disapproval toward Threshold and the Decimaes, viewing them as resistant to progress and trapped by outdated ideals. His perceived superiority over their rigid ways fueled a lingering disdain particularly toward Threshold.</p>
                    <p>Over time he came to realise he shared a similar fate with Threshold: both used as pawns by higher powers and vilified. This bridged the gap between them, though Threshold still has greater strength than Valsun with their armies.</p>

                <li>Valsun's aggressiveness and elitism comes from a lot of the issues with Windows 11's requirements
                    leading to things such as how <a
                        href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-in-three-work-pcs-not-capable-of-running-windows-11-here-are-the-upgrades-they-need/">one
                        in three work PCs "not capable" of running Windows 11</a> and <a
                        href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response">is
                        leaving millions of PCs behind</a>. Because of this <a
                        href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-surprising-number-of-pcs-cant-upgrade-to-windows-11-heres-why/">a
                        surprising number of PCs can't upgrade to Windows 11.</a></li>

                <li>Threshold having stronger forces compared to Valsun is a reference to how <a
                        href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/operating-systems/windows-11-market-share-declines-as-users-seemingly-shift-back-to-windows-10">Windows
                        11 market share declines as users seemingly shift back to Windows 10.</a></li>

                 <li>Valsun only represents the RTM version of Windows 11 which did not come with all the AI features as these did not come until the fourth component update to Windows 11, version 22H2. He does support it somewhat but not as much as the others of his species. Because of this him and Threshold also found common ground as they are both the RTM versions of their OSes.</li>

 <li>Him having a layered suit is a reference to the bloom wallpaper.</li>
                
                <li>Valsun having inner appreciation for the older Windows characters is a reference to the fact there are remnants of older versions in 11 itself. While some have been edited or whatever, some still exist.
