                        <h2>Character</h2>
                        <p>MS-DOS-kun is a short man in a beige <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #c4c5bf;"></span>(#c4c5bf) vertically striped shirt and red <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #93271d;"></span>(#93271d) pants, with the shirt tucked in to highlight the belt which transitions from yellow <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ab8f11;"></span>(#ab8f11) to red <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #c32b06;"></span>(#c32b06). He also wears glasses, has short brown <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #8b4513;"></span>(#8b4513) feathered hair and wears grey <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #929292;"></span>(#929292) and orange <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #b87423;"></span>(#b87423) shoes.</p>

                        <p>Despite being well known he didn't make his debut until 1982 and was the child to 86-DOS
                            sometime prior to the DOS Elite hiring 86-DOS. He has a twin brother who is slightly older
                            than him that represents PC-DOS.</p>

                        <p>He has a kind and gentle personality and is much less professional than PC-DOS as MS-DOS
                            wasn't as closely supervised by his higher ups, have a lot of pressure put onto him by his
                            higher ups and had the chance to explore the world more by working for other companies which
                            allowed him to gain more skills. Although his skills were originally very basic, he learned
                            some UNIX powers from XENIX around 1983 (only for both of them to be punished by the higher
                            ups leading to him having to pretend he forgot the spells) and gained multitasking abilities
                            around 1986.</p>

                        <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
                        <h3>XENIX</h3>
                        <p>Although it is a common misconception that XENIX-tan witnessed the very beginning of
                            MS-DOS-kun's existence, it is incorrect if we talking about him being born and right if we
                            talk about him growing up. She has always been incredibly caring and supportive towards him.
                            In fact, their relationship is much like that of a mother and her child. MS-DOS-kun greatly
                            admires and respects XENIX-tan for her guidance and wisdom. XENIX was also one the who
                            taught him some UNIX magic despite only being allowed to teach about UNIX philosophy but
                            couldn't go any further than to the point of teaching spells and magic. It wasn't until both
                            him and XENIX got caught that he was made to "unlearn" the spells... which he never really
                            did unlearn but rather kept hidden from the higher-ups.</p>

                        <p>He also has an attire inspired by hers that was obtained later on.</p>

                        <h3>86-DOS</h3>
                        <p>The parent to both MS-DOS and PC DOS, he never really got to meet them much unlike PC DOS
                            because of how MS-DOS traveled often to other factions.</p>

                        <h3>MIDAS</h3>
                        <p>MIDAS can sort of be considered MS-DOS's grandparent but they are more a distant relative
                            that MS-DOS never really met</p>

                        <h2>Abilities</h2>
                        <p>He uses the Disk Dagger which is a small dagger styled after the floppy disk. It's mostly
                            used for protecting against malware attacks.</p>

                        <h2>Trivia</h2>
                        <p>MS-DOS-kun being the younger sibling to PC DOS is a reference how the release date on
                            Wikipedia is incorrect. The source the Wikipedia entry for MS-DOS's release date for it goes
                            to a site that is a brief history of MS-DOS and is going by the release date for the IBM PC,
                            which is <a href="https://www.linfo.org/ms-dos.html">August 1981</a>. WinWorld also has it
                            under <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/ms-dos/1x">1981</a> whereas BetaWiki has <a
                                href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/MS-DOS_1">1982</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>WinWorld also has a copy of COMPAQ MS-DOS 1.10 which is pretty much a OEM version is from
                            1983 (boot screen says 1982 <a
                                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201002042421/http://16bitos.com/112ms.htm"> while
                                some OEMs labeled their release with different version numbers)</a> and the boot screen
                            for the COMPAQ version going by that site where I got the floppy diskette images from for
                            his clothes reports <a
                                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201002042421/http://16bitos.com/112ms.htm">1982</a>
                            as well... Plus you have The MS DOS Encyclopedia which states that the first version of DOS
                            for IBM PC is called <a
                                href="https://archive.org/details/The_MS-DOS_Encyclopedia_Ray_Duncan/page/56/mode/2up?view=theater">PC
                                DOS</a> and that the MS-DOS name didn't come until 1982. Let alone The MS DOS
                            Encyclopedia was published by Microsoft Press which is the publishing arm of Microsoft,
                            usually releasing books dealing with various current Microsoft technologies so it would be
                            weird to say the book is false.</p>
                        <p>Hell, even the first version of PC DOS reports 1981 on the <a
                                href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/IBM_PC-DOS_1.00">BetaWiki</a> unlike the first version
                            of MS-DOS.</p>

                            at WinWorldPC: MS-DOS 2.x had a few undocumented Unix-compatible commands built-in that were
                            originally intended to be a part of Microsoft's XEDOS. XEDOS was going to be Microsoft's
                            1981 Unix offering for the IBM PC that fitted somewhere between its single-user MS-DOS and
                            its multiuser Xenix, but was never released. Note that these commands were removed from
                            later versions of MS-DOS so this makes 2.x rather unique.</li>
