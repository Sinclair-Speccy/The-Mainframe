    <h2>Character</h2>
    <p>MS-DOS-kun is a short man with short dark hair and glasses, a white button-down shirt with a pocket, light blue pants, and a black and white tie. He has a kind and gentle personality but is also very intelligent and knowledgeable about computers. He values efficiency and simplicity in computing so he prioritizes functionality over unnecessary complexity, allowing him to perform tasks quickly and effectively with minimal resources. MS-DOS-kun is also adaptable to various situations noting that you have several special OEM versions and newer versions of DOS can run on a wide range of hardware.</p>
    <p>In 2018 he decided to show to teach the world his history so he open-sourced the MS-DOS source code.</p>

    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
    <h3>XENIX</h3>
    <p>XENIX-tan witnessed the very beginning of MS-DOS-kun's existence, and from that moment on, she has always been incredibly caring and supportive towards him. In fact, their relationship is much like that of a mother and her child. MS-DOS-kun greatly admires and respects XENIX-tan for her guidance and wisdom.</p>
	<p>XENIX was also one the who taught him some UNIX magic despite only being allowed to teach about UNIX philosophy but couldn't go any further than to the point of teaching spells and magic. It wasn't until both him and XENIX got caught that he was made to "unlearn" the spells... which he never really did unlearn but rather kept hidden from the higher-ups.</p>

    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <p>He uses the Disk Dagger which is a small dagger styled after the floppy disk. It's mostly used for protecting against malware attacks.</p>

		<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Vo8NG8T4rWs?si=rRS91VzDeT1BMlAo">Video on XEDOS.</a> - From a user at WinWorldPC: MS-DOS 2.x had a few undocumented Unix-compatible commands built-in that were originally intended to be a part of Microsoft's XEDOS. XEDOS was going to be Microsoft's 1981 Unix offering for the IBM PC that fitted somewhere between its single-user MS-DOS and its multiuser Xenix, but was never released. Note that these commands were removed from later versions of MS-DOS so this makes 2.x rather unique. </li>
