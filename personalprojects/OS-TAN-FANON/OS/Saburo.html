                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Macintosh System 3, known as Saburo McIntosh, is one of the triplets alongside his siblings
                        Macintosh System 2 and Macintosh System 1. Like his sibling they all share the same hair colour
                        and eye colour.</p>
                    <p>Saburo wears a grey <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #a8a8a8;"></span>(#a8a8a8) and black <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #1a1917;"></span>(#1a1917) suit paired with a matching tie and rectangular glasses. He is not
                        much of a fighter and more of known for his exceptional ability to remember vast amounts of
                        information that he is seen as the more formal and smarter out of his siblings... even though
                        sometimes he fills trash bins up enough that they bulge and explode.</p>
                    <p>Unlike his siblings he seemed to be a little more friendly unlike Prima who was boisterous and
                        Fuji who was more shy.</p>
                    <p>round 1986 he ended up really buggy for unknown reasons and the higherups had to get some doctors
                        to tend to him, but he got better quickly. During his time System 4 and System 6 made their
                        debuts so he helped them with their debuts.</p>

                    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
                    <h3>Macintosh System 1 & 2</h3>
                    <p>Out of the triplets, he tries to stay out of trouble but seems to fail most of the time.</p>

                    <h3>Apple Lisa & XENIX</h3>
                    <p>Although she is his mother, not much of his traits is actually from her. More of it is from XEROX
                        Alto-kun himself. Since Lisa was friends with XENIX-tan he got to meet her too.</p>

                    <h3>XEROX Alto</h3>
                    <p>The son of XEROX Alto, the two of them have a complicated relationship. Alto is the father of
                        System 3 but he left Lisa when the triplets were young. As a result System 3 doesn't know much
                        about him and hardly ever sees him. The only time System 3 really got to know his father was
                        when Alto tried to sue Lisa for custody of the triplets. In the end, Lisa won custody, and Alto
                        was ordered to pay child support.</p>

                    <h3>System 6</h3>
                    <p>They are sometimes seen as stepsiblings, despite System 3 being older than System 6 and System 6
                        not having any parents unlike System 3.</p>

                <li>Saburo and Aldebaran being "related" is a reference to how System Software 3.4 was released after
                    System 4 and just before System 6. They share the same finder version which is <a
                        href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Mac_System_Software_3.4#/media/File:MACSS34about.png">version
                        6.1.</a> Other versions of 3.4 use version 5.X (X for another number) as their finder version).
                    This is the System 6.0 finder version <a
                        href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Mac_System_Software_6.0#/media/File:Macss60about.png">which is
                        6.1 as well</a></li>

                <li>Him being known to make trash cans bulge is a reference to how in System 3.0, <a
                        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160808120506/http://www.mac512.com:80/macwebpages/system30.htm">the
                        Trash Can "bulged" when something was thrown away.</a></li>

                <li>System 3.0 was the first version to come with an <a
                        href="https://archive.org/details/mac_Macworld_Mac_Secrets_5th_Edition_1999/page/n333/mode/2up?view=theater">installer</a>.
                </li>

                <li>System 3.1 was <a

                    as it had serious flaws impacting file storage and system stability. You could say System 3.1.1
                    fixed these but <a
                        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160808121051/http://www.mac512.com/macwebpages/system32.htm">System
                        3.2 fixed over 30 bugs which most likely included these flaws.</a> System Software 3.1.1 was
                    only on the Guided Tour disk for the 512Ke, but I guess you can say it *did* fix some of the bugs in
                    the older version. 3.1.1 wasn't really a standalone version unlike 3.2, hence why I am not counting
                    it for when he got better.</li>
