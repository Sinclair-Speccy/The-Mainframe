            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Threshold has short brown hair and grey eyes. Her attire is inspired by the prototype Spartan suit and the fact that Windows 10 draws inspiration from the Halo franchise. She has elf ears, fangs, and a tail with a fluffy tip. She is known as a devoted Halo fan, often seen discussing its lore and gameplay strategies with Kiah. Microsoft's higher-ups, foreseeing Windows 10 as the last version of Windows, made a drastic decision to remove most of her reproductive organs, symbolizing the fact Windows 10 was said to be the last version of Windows.</p>
            <p>Not all of the members saw eye-to-eye with Decima. Some of the older members of The Windows Order felt overshadowed, neglected and did not like the higher-ups' methods of promoting her by using adware-like tactics to promote the operating system on its release. They also disliked the mandatory update installation. This unintentional division created tension within The Windows Order and she unintentionally drove away those members whose support had dwindled over time.</p>

            <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
            <h3>Windows 8</h3>
            <p>She pushed for users to embrace a more desktop-oriented interface, a departure from Tylan's tablet-oriented approach. Decima Threshold aimed to blend the touchscreen and desktop experiences seamlessly, addressing one of Tylan's key shortcomings and his bad reputation.</p>
            <h3>Windows 7</h3>
            <p>Threshold used to be snarky towards Septimus as he had a decent following many years after Windows 10 was released but grew to understand the fact she can't be the most popular OS of them all.</p>
			<h3>Windows 11</h3>
            <p>Threshold feels a sense of resentment towards Valsun, perceiving him as usurping her place within The Windows Order, a direct challenge to her own legacy, feeling threatened by the potential overshadowing of Windows 10 by its successor and departure from the familiar and established of Windows itself. She is ouestioning his legitimacy in the hierarchy of The Windows Order.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>Threshold is better at FPSes and is skilled with using guns.</p>

            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In Threshold's original portrayal from 2019 in Tabula Rasa, she was seen as "evil" and intentionally drove away the older Windows characters by doing purges:
                    <blockquote>
                        “Over the course of 2015 and into 2016, Threshold-tan, the first of the Windows 10-tans, drove away the Windows-tans whose support had lapsed, making it the largest faction purge in history.” — Tabula Rasa, 2019
                    </blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>When Threshold was being created, it was decided that since Windows 10 was thought to be the last version that each main update for Windows 10 would be a separate character, hence Windows 10 Threshold being a separate character.</li>
            </ul>
