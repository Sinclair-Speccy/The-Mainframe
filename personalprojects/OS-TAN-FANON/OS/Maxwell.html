            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Maxwell reflects the late '90s and early 2000s computer period with a style that is reminiscent of what kids would wear at the time. His upbeat, tech-savvy attitude fits with the spirit of Windows ME and its intended demographic of home users.</p>
            <p>Maxwell is dressed in an average baggy denim jacket with numerous '90s and Y2K patches. He's dressed in a green T-shirt below. His jeans are low-rise and wide-leg, in keeping with late-'90s design trends. His appearance is completed by a big, colourful belt that adds a young flair. He also wears a pair of neutral-coloured vintage skate shoes, a homage to popular footwear designs from the early 2000s. His accessories include a couple of bracelets and a silicone wristwatch, which exemplify the era's obsession with functional yet fashionable accessories.</p>
            <p>Maxwell's chestnut brown hair is casually styled, while his hazel eyes convey his enthusiasm for all things tech.</p>
            <p>However, he is also clumsy and accident-prone, but he is always willing to help others regardless, noting how buggy Windows ME was. He is also a klutz and can sometimes be a bit of a liability but he is always trying his best and is always willing to learn from his mistakes.</p>

            <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
            <h3>Windows 98</h3>
            <p>Given the similarity, Maxwell and Miles (Windows 98-tan) have developed a friendship. They frequently mention the technological advances of their respective periods, as well as how Windows ME attempted to expand on the foundation created by Windows 98. Miles, on the other hand, is occasionally baffled by some of the changes in Windows ME, notably the limited access to real-mode DOS, which was a break from their common history.</p>
            <h3>Windows 2000</h3>
            <p>While Maxwell admired Windows 2000's reliability and advanced networking capabilities, he couldn't help but feel a bit perplexed by the prioritization of business needs over consumer entertainment. Nonetheless, their occasional collaborations bridged the gap between their eras, showcasing the diversity of the Windows family and their shared commitment to technological progress.</p>

            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>In the event of a crash or damage, Maxwell has the power to return parts of his body to their original state. This might come in handy if he were to lose a limb or be wounded in an accident. Windows ME-kun would need to make a restore point in order to run System Restore. This is an instance of his physical condition. If he lost a limb or was harmed, Windows ME-kun may use the restoration point to return his body to its original state.</p>
            <p>Windows ME-kun can also use Windows Movie Maker to create and edit videos to confuse his enemies.</p>
            <p>However, Maxwell's abilities come with a caveat. Just as Windows ME faced stability issues, Maxwell is occasionally susceptible to unexpected glitches and crashes.</p>
