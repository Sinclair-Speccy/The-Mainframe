                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Born from the collaboration of Windows 1.0-tan and MS-DOS-kun, Windows 2.X-kun, his first goal
                        was to be a rebel right away, as much to their dismay.</p>
                    <p>Thomas boasts not one, but two distinctive personas: his Windows/286 form and his empowered alter
                        ego, Windows/386. His first form is his usual form that is more of a civilian attire. It
                        consists of a neon light blue suit jacket with a white jacket shirt that has large prints of
                        black geometric patterns and neon light blue pants that have black stripes up the sides of the
                        pants.</p>
                    <p>His alter-ego outfit consists of a form-fitting black bodysuit, a bold neon Screamin' Green
                        leather jacket, ultramarine blue cargo pants and black combat boots and Electric blue
                        sunglasses. It allows him to protect himself more easily.</p>
                    <p>He was known as being a rebel due to messing with The Infinite Loop yet <i>somehow</i> still
                        became a version most humans overlook...</p>

                    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
                    <h3>MS-DOS</h3>
                    <p>Although MS-DOS pretends to be in dismay towards Windows 2.X-kun's rebelness, he is actually
                        amused by it due to himself being see as a rebel by the higher ups of the Blue Gene Collective.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Windows 1.X</h3>
                    <p>Windows 1.X-tan never approved of his reckless behaviour due to him completely ignoring the fact
                        she made an agreement with The Infinite Loop and him breaking in to steal some of their things.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Higher ups of TIL</h3>
                    <p>They disapproved of him breaking in to steal some of their stuff to get their look and feel that
                        it led to them getting angry at both him and Windows 1.X-tan. Despite this the higher ups of The
                        Infinite Loop gave him *some* things to try and make him go away such as a device that allowed
                        him to access some of their networks, altough he kept sending weird stuff over to their
                        printers...</p>
