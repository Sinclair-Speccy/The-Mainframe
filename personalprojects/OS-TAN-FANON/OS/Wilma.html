        <h2>Character</h2>
        <p>Windows 1.0-tan is a kind and gentle OS-tan who is always willing to help others. She is cheerful and optimistic. She wears a dress that is bright and colourful in the colours of dark blue, neon green, yellow and red and has short hair that is the same colour as her eyes. She is the founder and matriarch of The Windows Order. Windows 1.0-tan is the mother of Windows 2.X-kun and Windows 3.X-kun.</p>
        <p>Though she has seen many changes and technological advancements over the years, Wilma remains humble and maintains a strong connection with her roots. She cherishes her friendship with MS-DOS-kun, whom she sees as a trusted ally and mentor.</p>
        <p>In her spare time Wilma enjoys playing Reversi, reminiscing about her past achievements and the journey that brought her to The Mainframe in the first place.</p>
		<p>Before Wilma even made her debut as Windows 1.0-tan, the higher ups of DOS Elite along with XENIX-tan and MS-DOS-kun went to an event that had new and old OS-tans alike showcasing things and giving presentations. While they were there, Visi On-kun caught their eye with his presentation. Intrigued by Visi On-kun’s presentation the higher-ups, XENIX-tan, and MS-DOS-kun decided that The Windows Order needed a suitable competitor to rival to compete against Visi On. Learning about The Infinite Loop's Macintosh System 1-tan only fueled the need for a competitor.</p>
		<p>They found a willing volunteer named Wilma within the territory for the DOS Elite who accepted to become Windows 1.0. Her abilities were limited, more like MS-DOS-kun's instead of an actual OS, very unstable (most likely caused by her sort of being a human prior to this) and sometimes sleeping when she was meant to be training. Her attire was more plain too, being mostly blacks, whites and greys similar to MS-DOS-kun's outfit.</p>

        <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
        <h3>MS-DOS-kun</h3>
        <p>Windows 1.0-tan has a close relationship with MS-DOS-kun. She greatly respects his experience and the role he played in shaping her early years. They often reminisce about the past, and she credits him for helping her become the operating system she is today.</p>
        <h3>Windows 2.X-kun</h3>
        <p>Windows 2.X-kun, her firstborn, holds a special place in Wilma's heart. She is proud of his growth and how he has taken after her reliability and practicality. Windows 2.X-kun's introduction of true overlapping windows brought a sense of multitasking harmony to their digital realm, making Wilma grateful for his contributions to their family legacy.</p>
        <h3>Windows 3.X-kun</h3>
        <p>Windows 3.X-kun is Wilma's second child, and she is very proud of him. He is a talented and versatile individual, and he is always looking for new ways to challenge himself.</p>
        <p>One of the things that Wilma admires most about Windows 3.X-kun is his versatility. He is not only a skilled operating system, but he is also a talented businessman. He runs a bustling hotdog stand, and he is very good at multitasking. He is able to juggle the demands of running a business while also being creative and innovative.</p>
        <h3>Macintosh System 1-tan</h3>
        <p>At first, Wilma, known as Windows 1.0-tan, felt uneasy about Macintosh System 1-tan, seeing it as a potential rival to her own capabilities. She couldn't help expressing her concerns openly. However, her perspective began to change when she had a heartfelt conversation with her brother, Fuji McIntosh. Fuji intervened when Prima was being a jerk to Wilma.</p>
        <h3>Macintosh System 2-kun</h3>
        <p>Noting that Windows 1.0 was released the same year as Macintosh System 2, Wilma and Fuji never got along at first as Windows 1.0 could not compete with Apple's OS however they became friendly to each other after Fuji defended her from Prima's rudeness towards her as Prima felt that Windows 1.0 was a threat to the Macintosh, and she was not afraid to show it. Fuji was appalled by Prima's behaviour towards her.</p>
