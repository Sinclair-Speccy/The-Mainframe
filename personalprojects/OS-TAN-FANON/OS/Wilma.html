            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Windows 1.0-tan is a kind and gentle OS-tan that wears a bright and colourful attire that consists of a neon green <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #4df878;"></span>(#4df878) Windbreaker jacket with a horizontal stripe across the chest that fades from red <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ff5555;"></span>(#ff5555) to blue <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #55ffff;"></span>(#55ffff), baggy white <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ffffff;"></span>(#ffffff) pants with a geometric print that are in the colours of red <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ff5555;"></span>(#ff5555), green <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #4df878;"></span>(#4df878), yellow <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ffff55;"></span>(#ffff55), and gray <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #888888;"></span>(#888888) and white <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ffffff;"></span>(#ffffff) sneakers with dark blue <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #0000a9;"></span>(#0000a9) accents. She also has a scarf that is mainly black <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #231f20;"></span>(#231f20) with light blue <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #96c4eb;"></span>(#96c4eb) at the end that is mostly worn wrapped around the neck with the coloured end hanging down to be visible.</p>

            <p>
              She is the founder of The Windows Order and has two children that
              represent Windows 2.X and Windows 3.X.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though she has seen many changes and technological advancements
              over the years, Wilma remains cheerful despite being seen as
              vaporwave way before she even made her debut. In her spare time
              Wilma enjoys playing Reversi but also sometimes takes her time
              arranging things side by side unlike stacking them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before Wilma even made her debut as Windows 1.0-tan, the higher
              ups of DOS Elite along with XENIX-tan and MS-DOS-kun went to an
              event that had new and old OS-tans alike showcasing things and
              giving presentations. While they were there, Visi On-kun caught
              their eye with his presentation. Intrigued by Visi On-kun’s
              presentation the higher-ups, XENIX-tan, and MS-DOS-kun decided
              that The Windows Order needed a suitable competitor to rival to
              compete against Visi On. Learning about The Infinite Loop's
              Macintosh System 1-tan only fueled the need for a competitor.
            </p>
            <p>
              They found a willing volunteer named Wilma within the territory
              for the DOS Elite who accepted to become Windows 1.0. Her
              abilities were limited, more like MS-DOS-kun's instead of an
              actual OS, very unstable (most likely caused by her sort of being
              a human prior to this) and sometimes sleeping when she was meant
              to be training. Her attire was more plain too, being mostly
              blacks, whites and greys similar to MS-DOS-kun's outfit.
            </p>
            <p>
              It wasn't until she made her full debut that she got her new and
              flashy attire.
            </p>

            <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
            <h3>MS-DOS-kun</h3>
            <p>
              Windows 1.0-tan has a close relationship with MS-DOS-kun since he
              helped her a lot with her debut and was often with her in case
              something went wrong, although sometimes even <i>he</i> causes her
              to crash at times, mostly accidental that is
            </p>
            <h3>Windows 2.X-kun</h3>
            <p>
              Windows 2.X was her first child and safe to say... a bit of a
              rebel as he got into trouble by the Infinite Loop's higher ups in
              1988. Why? Because he "borrowed" something of theirs to be much
              cooler than his mom. Not that she approved of his reckless
              behaviour.
            </p>
            <h3>Windows 3.X-kun</h3>
            <p>
              Windows 3.X is her other son but often got worried about him due
              to the OS wars that were happening between The Windows Order and
              The Infinite Loop although she does enjoy his multimedia
              capabilities... and his hot dog stand.
            </p>
            <h3>Macintosh System 1-tan</h3>
            <p>
              At first Wilma felt uneasy about Macintosh System 1-tan, seeing
              her as a potential rival to her own capabilities as Wilma at the
              time was new to this whole faction stuff, but she may have
              expressed her concerns a little <i>too</i> open. However, her
              perspective began to change when she had a heartfelt conversation
              with her brother, Fuji McIntosh when Fuji intervened when Prima
              was being a jerk to Wilma.
            </p>
            <h3>Macintosh System 2-kun</h3>
            <p>
              Noting that Windows 1.0 was released the same year as Macintosh
              System 2, Wilma and Fuji never got along at first as Windows 1.0
              could not compete with Apple's OS. They became friendly to each
              other after Fuji defended her from Prima's rudeness towards her as
              Prima felt that Windows 1.0 was a threat to the Macintosh, and she
              was not afraid to show it. Fuji was appalled by Prima's behaviour
              towards her.

        <ul>
            <li>Wilma being confused at being called "Windows 1.0" is a reference to how despite Windows 1.0 being known as the first version, Windows 1.0 or 1.00 is the name often associated with the final release of Windows 1.0, even though there was no release with this version number. The first official release was version 1.01 so it makes sense to call her Windows 1.01 or 1.0X-tan instead of Windows 1.0-tan.</li>
