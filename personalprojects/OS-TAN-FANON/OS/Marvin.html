                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Marvin wears a ripped shirt that is various shades of blue (more so this one <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #5188b1;"></span>(#5188b1), has tattoos on his upper arms, long, wavy and parted in the middle brown <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #8a6d65;"></span>(#8a6d65) hair, a necklace with a seashell, grey <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #8a8b8d;"></span>(#8a8b8d) shorts, and a brown <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #67533b;"></span>(#67533b) bracelet. Unlike his
                        siblings before him he attempted to drift away from their "old style" and promote a new one
                        similar to iOS 7-tan, although slightly less successfully.</p>
                    <p>He’s got a knack for surfing, is energetic, very sociable, friendly, helpful, speaks surfer slang
                        and has a surfboard. He also has a good sense of direction and a love for reading.</p>
                    <p>Despite all this, he tries to be generous even though the high ups quickly kicked him under the
                        carpet (not literally), sort of forgiving him years later.</p>

                    <h3>iOS 7-tan</h3>
                    <p>Tamika and Marvin are often seen as a duo since they were introduced together, but they aren't
                        exactly the same. She is more sillier than Marvin, can't swim, wears more stylish clothes and
                        acts like she is stuck in 2013 with her jokes, slang and humor. Their outfits are also
                        contrasting with one another, although Marvin did feel a bit overshadowed by her as more people
                        drifting their attention to her.</p>
