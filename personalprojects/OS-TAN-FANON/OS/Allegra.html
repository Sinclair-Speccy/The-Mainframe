        <h2>Character</h2>
        <p>Allegra, one of the more famous people from Antikythera, wears a <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #b0c4de;"></span> light blue (#b0c4de) zip-up hoodie with long sleeves layered over a long-sleeved shirt, a <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #808080;"></span> grey (#808080) belt featuring system icons, <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #2f2f2f;"></span> dark grey (#2f2f2f) denim jeans, and <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #000000;"></span> black (#000000) platform sandals along with accessories such as a grey necklace featuring the rainbow Apple logo and earrings. She enjoys <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #d5d5d5;"></span> platinum-colored (#d6d6d6) aesthetics but also a little bit of colourful Y2K (  
                <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #069ac0;"></span> Blueberry (#069ac0), 
                <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #64638f;"></span> Grape (#64638f), 
                <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #ff9f1b;"></span> Tangerine (#ff9f1b), 
                <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #02ac3f;"></span> Lime (#02ac3f),
                <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #bf005d;"></span> Strawberry (#bf005d)). She also has long, wavy <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #e9a254;"></span> Porsche coloured hair that flows down past her shoulders that is is parted slightly off-center at the front.
            </p>
            <p>Allegra is deeply passionate about music, acting, art, appreciates efficiency and prefers a de-cluttered approach to life, focusing only on what matters most. She can sometimes oversimplify problems though can miss some important stuff. She enjoys giving fashion advice to others. While she dislikes TWO, she does get along with some of its members. Allegra is also known for her willingness to help others find lost items, whether physical belongings or important ideas.</p>
            <p>Of course, her life wasn’t all happy and joyful. She was initiated during a period when TWO and TIL were at war with TWO emerging victorious. It was during this time that NeXTSTEP-tan found Allegra. Unimpressed by how Jillian was managing the war and TIL, NeXTSTEP initiated Allegra and had Jillian mentor her. NeXTSTEP then manipulated her into betraying everything Jillian had taught her. Under NeXTSTEP's influence, Allegra tore down Jillian's efforts while helping to bring TIL back onto its feet. This led her to become an idol without people not knowing that she was manipulated into doing so, creating a wave of new trends in fashion and music. She even started creating her own songs which quickly gained a massive following. Years later, Allegra was still loved by fans who created dedicated fansites and forums in her honor.</p>
        
        <p>In the end NeXTSTEP tossed her away anyway, having Mac OS X 10.0-kun try to kill her and fail because her guards stopped him.</p>

        <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>

        <h3>Jillian</h3>
        <p>Once Allegra's mentor, Jillian and Allegra had a complicated relationship. When Jillian's vision was dismantled he saw Allegra as someone who was tearing down his work. This led to tension between them but over time, they found a way to redeem their relationship. Allegra initially found Jillian to be outdated and unfashionable despite having once worn his old outfits.</p>

        <h3>TWO</h3>
        <p>Despite her general dislike for TWO, Allegra managed to get along with some of its members. She even tried to copy Alya's style at one point.</p>
