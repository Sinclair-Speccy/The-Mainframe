            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Yggdrasil Linux-tan is depicted as a wise and intelligent woman wearing a green <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #326043;"></span>(#326043) hangerock worn over a long-sleeved underdress. The underdress is light blue <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #84bbd5;"></span>(#84bbd5) with red cuffs <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #c26174;"></span>(#c26174) and a grey neckline <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #d2d2d2;"></span>(#d2d2d2) which is adorned with ornate embroidery of intricate Nordic patterns in pink <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #fcc6cf;"></span>(#fcc6cf) with a pair of reddish taupe grey <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #894858;"></span>(#894858) brooches at the shoulders, and a braided belt securing the waist in the colours of green <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #03a985;"></span>(#03a985), orange <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #c1582b;"></span>(#c1582b), and yellow <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #dbcb42;"></span>(#dbcb42). The belt's ends are tasseled, hanging down at the front.</p>

<p>Yggdrasil-tan's former attire was an early medieval-style outfit; a simple reddish brown tunic <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #280c0b;"></span>(#280c0b) with white sleeves <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f5f5f5;"></span>(#f5f5f5), white leggings <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f5f5f5;"></span>(#f5f5f5), brown <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #402625;"></span>(#402625) boots and gloves <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #402625;"></span>(#402625) and a Viking helmet with gnu horns.</p>

            <p>
              She was around the 3rd one to be initiated by The Kernel in 1992
              however unlike MCC Interim and TAMU who came before her, she tried
              to be able to work with everyone without issues, attempted to
              bring people together, wrote books and even made VHS tapes with
              her instructing humans how to install Red Hat, Slackware and
              Yggdrasil itself (although the tapes were sadly lost to time).
            </p>
            <p>
              Although her last release was around fall 1995 she continued to be
              active to sell Linux Internet Archives disks which led to her
              meeting and becoming friends with MCC Interim Linux-tan,
              Jurix-kun, Xdenu-tan, Mini-Linux-tan and SLS-kun although
              sometimes she would compare herself to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              She is also an advocate for the old web and free software, even
              going to the lengths to say "Free software for the rest of us".
            </p>
            <p>
              Around before she disappeared in the 2000s around March, she even
              went to the lengths to set up an experimental repository for
              humans for other things besides for what she had only.
            </p>
            <p>
              It wasn't until around the 2020s when she was found again by
              several vintage OSes and computers. After being found she tried to
              go back to what she once called home, only to find out it had
              become a gambling building, as much to her dismay.
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh, and she hates it when you say Yggdrasil as in the tree of life
              and not the other way to pronounce it...
            </p>

            <h2>Relationships</h2>
            <h3>
              MCC Interim Linux-tan, Jurix-kun, Xdenu-tan  and SLS-kun
            </h3>
            <p>
              The main friends of Yggdrasil-tan, they assisted in her running
              her store as they come from different backgrounds and have
              different strengths. Yggdrasil-tan is grateful for their help in
              running her store, and she knows that she can always count on them
              for support.
            </p>
            <h3>Debian-tan</h3>
            <p>
              They first met in 1996 when Debian-tan visited Yggdrasil's store.
              Debian-tan was not impressed with the versions of Debian that
              Yggdrasil was selling as they were corrupt, annoyed at Yggdrasil
              for selling faulty copies of her work. Despite Yggdrasil fixing
              them, whenever Debian forgave her is up to debate.
            </p>
            <h3>MkLinux-tan</h3>
            <p>
              They never really interacted besides when Yggdrasil was attempting
              to promote freeware software.

            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>
              Yggdrasil Linux-tan is highly versatile and adaptable to various
              environments. This flexibility can be compared to a warrior's
              ability to adapt to different battle scenarios and employ various
              tactics however she is not used to more modern hardware.

              Her attire is a mixture of the

            </li>

            <li>
              Her writing books is a reference to how Yggdrasil Incorporated,
              the company that made the OS, published some of the early Linux
              compilation books such as
              <a href="https://archive.org/details/linuxbiblegnutes00john"
                >The Linux Bible: The GNU Testament</a
              >. Yggdrasil Incorporated also goes by Yggdrasil Computing.
            </li>

            <li>
              The idea of her recording herself and teaching humans how to
              install Linux is a reference to how Yggdrasil Computing shipped
              the world's first video seminar on installing Linux called
              <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970520050656/http://www.yggdrasil.com/Products/intro_video.html"
                 >"Linux Installation and Beyond."</a>. At the time of when this entry was added I origianlly could not find a link to the VHS recording until September 13th, 2024, when I was researching the manual that came with Yggdrasil. One of the research results was the <a href="https://youtu.be/2IAa6MYVpVs?si=6lZ6Co4IUautm0fh"
                 >Youtube video of it</a> was uploaded a month eariler, so its safe to say her recordings were found.
            </li>

            <li>
              Her meeting various other distros is a reference to the
              <a href="https://archive.org/details/lia_895_5cd"
                >Linux Internet Archives</a
              >
              which are CDs from Yggdrasil Incorporated that have source code
              from various sites.
            </li>

            <li>
              The reason for her sometimes comparing herself to her friends is
              because Yggdrasil made comparisons between their products and
              competitors. More about that can be found
              <a

            <li>
              The advocacy for the old web is a reference to how the W3C
              approved Yggdrasil to coordinate future development of
              <a href="https://archive.org/details/linuxbiblegnutes00john"

              Graphics (PNG), and libwww. Arena was widely used and popular at
              the beginning of the World Wide Web. Meanwhile the advocacy for
              free software comes from the fact the

              use of free software. This is also how she met MkLinux-tan.
            </li>

            <li>
              Her saying "Free software for the rest of us" is a direct quote on
              the site for Yggdrasil.

              Yggdrasil is not pronounced as you would expect it to be. The

            <li>
              Debian-tan being annoyed at faulty copies of her OS being sold is
              a reference to how

              had corrupt Debian files so they had to send out replacement CDs.
            </li>

            <li>
              The former attire is a reference to how this is simply an improved
              version of an already existing Yggdrasil Linux-tan which was only
              created from a non-coloured screenshot and had a lack of research.
              This prompted me at the time (2020s) to try and gather more better
              research along with emulate it in colour which was a success in
              <a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vintageunix/comments/pedqdl/yggdrasil_linux_working_for_once_fall_1995_edition/"
                >2021</a
              >, although there may have been people who emulated it way earlier
              than I did.
            </li>
              <li>Yggdrasil and her friends getting attacked is a reference to the Halloween documents as Microsoft published documents about competing against Linux in the very late 90s to the early 2000s. Microsoft acknowledged in some ways Linux was superior to Windows but devised strategies to try to discredit Linux. While this didn't happen during 1995 when the CDs were first sold, the site for Yggdrasil was still up until 2005 and the last Halloween document is from 2004. Yggdrasil was still technically selling stuff during this time, even making the world's first Linux DVD9-ROM with 8GB of open source software in 2000.</li>
