                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Copland Nu is a man born from an unknown digital realm with wavy, shoulder-length very light
                        lilac hair and lilac eyes. Copland wears a cape that envelops his entire body which is blue. His
                        cape includes a hood. Underneath the cape, he has a white vest with thin notch lapels and
                        stamped metal buttons, a black belt, black pants, grey boots and lilac gloves. He started off as
                        optimistic and ambitious, driven by a vision of progress and innovation, aiming to bring
                        positive change but started to face difficulties. Copland faced adversity with unwavering
                        determination.</p>

                    <p>He faced issues like instability and fragility as he strived to push the boundaries but it seemed
                        too late, as it wasn't long until he recognised that his initial purpose was not working out,
                        causing him distress and forcing him to reevaluate his path. The higher-ups of The Infinite Loop
                        ended up sending him off as he proved to be too expensive to keep around. He is determined to
                        prove himself and rise above the setbacks, despite being left struggling with feelings of
                        inadequacy, frustration, and a sense of unfinished business, often questioning his own
                        abilities.</p>

                    <p>He's now part of the Retrograde Conglomerate after being a wanderer for so long and Taligent
                        convinced him to join them. At times when he doesn't want to be known who he is he uses the name
                        "Maxwell".</p>

                    <h3>System 7 and 7.5</h3>
                    <p>Out of all The Infinite Loop members, Copland gets along well with Pleiades and Amadea and were
                        the ones to know him well enough before he was kicked out.</p>

                    <h2>Trivia</h2>
                    <p>It is said that Copland comes from the future, 2030 to be exact but no one actually knows if this
                        is true or not.</p>

            <h2>References and sources</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland_(operating_system)">Wikipedia entry on Copland.</a>
                </li>

                <li>He also represents Copland's tentatively planned successor, codenamed Gershwin.</li>

                <li>Ellen Hancock was the reason why the Copland project was killed of. <a
                        href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Copland"> After only a few months, she realised that the
                        situation was hopeless, and given current development and engineering it would never ship at
                        all.</a></li>

                <li>When Nagel left Apple <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/478147/apple-history-mac-os-copland/">,
                        Apple insisted that the operating system would ship eventually despite the loss of a key player.
                        However, Nagel’s departure came soon after Apple posted a staggering $740 million loss.</a></li>
                <li>The last name "Nu" comes from the <a
                        href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Copland_build_D7E1">Nukernel</a>, a microkernel that was
                    developed at Apple Computer during the early 1990s. It was the basis for the Copland operating
                    system. Copland build D7E1 runs entirely on top of NuKernel, while relying on a Mac OS 7 (this is
                    where him being friends with System 7 and 7.5 comes from) although it is widely unstable, and often
                    crashes upon performing certain tasks.</li>
                <li>Members of Apple's software QA team joked that, given current resources and the number of bugs in
                    the system, they could clear the program for shipping <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland_(operating_system)#Developer_Release"> sometime
                        around 2030.</a></li>
                <li> His first name comes from the <a
                        href="https://www.mackido.com/CodeNames/MacOSSoftware.html#Other%20OS%20Projects"> Copland
                        codename which is named after Aaron Copland, a musician. His other name is Maxwell, an internal
                        code name for Copland.</a></li>
