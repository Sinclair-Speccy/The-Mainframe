            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Owena is depicted as an older woman with greying <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #d3d3d3;"></span>(#d3d3d3) hair, has glasses and dresses in a classic professor's attire, wearing a medium light grey <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #a3a0a5;"></span>(#a3a0a5) tweed jacket with elbow patches, a light grey <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #cccccc;"></span>(#cccccc) dress shirt, a medium dark blue-magenta <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #4e4c5a;"></span>(#4e4c5a) tie, and medium light grey <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #a3a0a5;"></span>(#a3a0a5) pants.</p>

            <p>
              Owena "Interim" Le Blanc was one of The Kernel's first followers after The Kernel kind of just... randomly appeared at the university she was working at. At that time she was confused on what had come to see her as she thought this was all a dream, but The Kernel told her this was not a dream at all and that they thought she was the perfect candidate for the first initiation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confused at first, Owena ended up caving in to The Kernel's suggestions and allowed herself to be initiated and allowing herself to be permitted to initiate others, making the process more simple. Of course it was successful and she was considered the first one who was more user friendly. Despite being busy, she couldn't resist adding more and more utilities as humans requested them, though she often joked about how cramped her storage was becoming. Word about her initiation spread very quickly as others began to seek out The Kernel to be initiated like she was so they could either use these new powers for good or evil.
            </p>
            <p>
              Around 1995 an eager Linux distro known as Yggdrasil was selling CDs at her store which had some of Owena's source code although she didn't complain, helped Yggdrasil sell more and even met some new friends. After Yggdrasil's shop went out of business, Owena lost contact with the other OS-tans. She was sad to see them go, but she knew that they had to move on with their lives. Owena often thought about her friends that Yggdrasil helped her make and wondered what they were up to, and she hoped that they were doing well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Years later, Owena accidentally stumbled upon the Retrograde Conglomerate which was a non-profit organization dedicated to assisting retiring OS-tans in living a better life. Owena was surprised to see that some of her friends were there, and she was happy to be reunited with them. She would laugh about how at times she had to work around the limitations of her powers, making additional tools to get around these limits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike the others from around the early days she can be considered one of the more "in-touch" characters.

            <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
            <h3>
              Yggdrasil Linux-tan, Jurix-kun, Xdenu-tan  and SLS-kun
            </h3>
            <p>
              Owena "Interim" Le Blanc has developed close relationships with Yggdrasil Linux-tan, Jurix-kun, Xdenu-tan, and SLS-kun as they are friends Yggdrasil introduced her to when Yggdrasil was selling CDs with her source code to try and preserve the history of those who came before her during the 90s.
            </p>
            <p>
              She worried that they would have seen her as "too old" since she was the 2nd oldest out of them all, but this did not seem to bother them as at times they were attacked by Windows 95 and 98-tan who saw the group as enemies.
            </p>
            <h3>Debian-tan</h3>
            <p>
              She never saw Debian as a major rival but instead viewed Debian as
              a respected member of The League of the Kernel, even helping her
              encourage some of her users to support Debian instead of herself.

              Owena working at a university is a parallel to how it was made by
              Owen Le Blanc of the
              <a href="https://archiveos.org/mcc-interim/"
                >Manchester Computing Centre (MCC)</a

              courses, hence Owena using her new powers to teach these things.

            <li>
              The same reference used in the one above talks about how very
              shortly after the first MCC Interim version of Linux appeared,
              other people released similar versions such as Dave Safford's TAMU
              releases and Martin Junius's MJ versions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Owena meeting Yggdrasil and becoming friends with her is a
              reference to the
              <a href="https://archive.org/details/lia_895_5cd"
                >Linux Internet Archives</a
              >
              which were sold by Yggdrasil Computing, the company which created
              Yggdrasil Linux/GNU/X.
            </li>
            <li>
              Owena meeting Debian is a reference to how version

              of MCC Interim was close to Debian as possible, encourghing ussers
              to use Debian and even helping them install Debian using the MCC
              boot and root disks.
            </li>
              <li>Owena being one of the few people permitted to initiate is a reference to how one of MCC's goals was to have a simple installation procedure. it also has a menu-driven installer</li>
              <li>
              Owena being more in-touch is a reference to how the Manchester Linux User Group has
              <a

                >QEMU images along with guides on running them</a
              >
              for the OS by Owen himself. ManLUG also comes from the University where MCC originated from, Manchester Computing Centre.
            </li>
              <li>Owena and her friends getting attacked is a reference to the Halloween documents as Microsoft published documents about competing against Linux in the very late 90s to the early 2000s. Microsoft acknowledged in some ways Linux was superior to Windows but devised strategies to try to discredit Linux. While this didn't happen during 1995 when the CDs were first sold, the site for Yggdrasil was still up until 2005 and the last Halloween document is from 2004. Yggdrasil was still technically selling stuff during this time, even making the world's first Linux DVD9-ROM with 8GB of open source software in 2000.</li>
