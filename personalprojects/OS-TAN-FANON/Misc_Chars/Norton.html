            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Norton-kun is a young man with short brown <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #5f4136;"></span>(#5f4136) hair and glasses. He wears a dark gray <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #25303c;"></span>(#25303c) suit with yellow-gold <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #c0a000;"></span>(#c0a000) accents on the lapels, edges, and pockets, a white shirt <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #fefefe;"></span>(#fefefe) with a yellow-gold tie <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f7d736;"></span>(#f7d736), a dark gray belt <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #4b4d4d;"></span>(#4b4d4d) featuring a yellow-gold buckle and dark gray shoes <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #4b4d4d;"></span>(#4b4d4d) with yellow-gold <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f7d736;"></span>(#f7d736) laces. His glasses have dark gray <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #4b4d4d;"></span>(#4b4d4d) frames, and he wears a yellow-gold <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #f7d736;"></span>(#f7d736) watch. Norton-kun represents all products made by Peter Norton Computing, including antivirus software, disk utilities, and system tools and the software after Norton was acquired by Symantec.</p>


            <p>
              He was originally a human who recovered a file after they
              accidentally deleted it but thought being a human was too limiting
              for him to be able to do tasks effectively, so he was initiated
              into being a Program-kun instead.
            </p>

            <p>
              He started as a data restorer, specializing in recovering erased
              files for MS-DOS-kun, PC-DOS-kun, and Windows 3.X-kun. He would
              also repair damaged files, complete floppy disk displays and maps,
              and make easy changes to floppy disk sectors and all sorts of
              stuff however he was well known for recovering erased files.
              Norton and Windows 3.X did not talk much until 1994 with him
              having to consult Norton at one point. With his new success, he
              stepped into authorship and decided he wished to gain more skills
              so his followers helped support him with this goal. In August
              1990, the higher-ups as part of his company sold the company to
              Symantec for $70 million, therefore he was hired by Symantec
              Antivirus-kun... or well, "hired".
            </p>

            <p>
              The merger introduced Norton to malware challenges, initially
              struggling but eventually creating the NAV gun for effective
              defense. One of his main rivals was the malware known as
              Michelangelo from around 1992. Symantec Antivirus-kun disappeared
              in 1998 despite being his tutor with dealing with malware, even
              though Norton was not good at it at first. From 2000 onwards,
              Norton faced criticism for system performance impact, cooperation
              with the FBI, faulty updates, and ethical concerns.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2007, Norton had the chance to upgrade his gun into the
              NAV-N360. Acquisitions his company resulted in Norton living with
              three sisters - Avast, AVG, and Avira - collectively combating
              malware despite Norton's tarnished reputation.

            <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
            <h3>Symantec Antivirus</h3>
            <p>
              Symantec Antivirus, the man who had hired him. Symantec Antivirus
              ended up feeling like that Norton could do his job better and the
              higher-ups only added to this feeling when SAM was renamed Norton
              AntiVirus (NAV) for Macintosh.
            </p>
            <p>
              Norton feels bad about Symantec Antivirus being replaced by him
              but doesn't know his whereabouts after he disappeared in 1998.
            </p>

            <h3>Avast, AVG and Avira</h3>
            <p>
              Avast, AVG and Avira are considered to be Norton's stepsisters,
              noting that their parent companies had been either brought or
              merged with Gen Digital.
            </p>

            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>
              Despite being a man of multiple talents, he is well known for
              being able to recover data that had been deleted or erased,
              assisting DOS-tans (mainly MS-DOS) in finding stuff and fighting
              malware.
            </p>
            <p>
              He also wields the NAV-N360, a rifle he uses for fighting malware.
              The name is a combination of Norton AntiVirus and Norton 360. It
              used to be called NAV until he upgraded it to have more powers.

                Symantec Antivirus being Norton's teacher but then disappearing
                is a reference to how

                copies of Symantec AntiVirus

                >, but I ended up finding one so Symantec AntiVirus isn't so
                gone after all.

                Avast, AVG and Avira being his stepsisters is a reference to how

                  >Norton, AVG, Avira, and Avast are products sold by Gen

                Since Norton is a catch-all character for the software &
                products made by Norton Computing and after Norton was acquired
                by Symantec, some parts of his character come from Peter Norton
                himself such as how
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norton#Utility_software"
                  >Peter Norton wrote a program to recover information from
                  disks rather than re-entering data</a
                >

              <li>

                  >Norton Commander is a file manager released by Peter Norton
                  Computing</a

              <li>
                His debut as a "MalwareBuster" in the 1990s is a reference to
                how back in
                <a
                  href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cFAEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA3&pg=PA18#v=twopage&q&f=false"
                  >early 1991</a
                >, Norton Group launched Norton AntiVirus 1.0 for PC and
                compatible computers due to foreign virus strains emerging as
                the latest threat to U.S. PCs.
              </li>

              <li>
                Norton being friends with MS-DOS, PC-DOS and Windows 3.X is a
                reference to how Version 1.0 of Norton Utilities supported DOS
                1.x whereas Version 8.0 adds Windows 3.1 utilities.
              </li>

              <li>
                Norton-kun being a catch-all character for all Norton software
                is due to the fact the currently existing Norton only
                representing Norton Antivirus and being kind of a bad portrayal
                of Norton Antivirus itself. I mean, Peter Norton seems like a
                chill guy based on his Wikipedia page while John McAfee was a
                total nutjob plus Norton Utilities did not include antivirus
                features.
              </li>

              <li>
                Norton having a rocky start with his debut is a reference to how
                the original Norton Antivirus 1.0 had a bug that does not repair
                infected files or boot sectors properly which was fixed in
                version 1.5.
              </li>

              <li>
                Norton facing criticism and becoming somewhat cynical is a
                reference to how as the years passed, Norton was seen as a
                crappy antivirus because it came preinstalled on some computers,
                but also the fact
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_AntiVirus#FBI_cooperation"
                  >Symantec and other major antivirus vendors whitelisted the
                  Magic Lantern trojan, rendering their antivirus products,
