                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Norton-kun is represented as a young man with short brown hair, glasses, a white suit with yellow accents, white pants, and a yellow tie. He often has his arms crossed, but this is not because he is annoyed. It is simply a way of showing that he is confident. Norton-kun represents all products made by Peter Norton Computing, including antivirus software, disk utilities, and system tools and the software after Norton was acquired by Symantec. He is a friendly and helpful character who is always willing to help users keep their computers safe and secure.</p>
					<p>He started as a data restorer, specializing in recovering erased files for MS-DOS-kun, PC-DOS-kun, and Windows 3.X-kun. He would also repair damaged files, complete floppy disk displays and maps, and make easy changes to floppy disk sectors and all sorts of stuff however he was well known for recovering erased files. Norton and Windows 3.X did not talk much until 1994 with him having to consult Norton as a doctor at one poin. Norton ventured into authorship and decided he wished to gain more skills so his follower helped support him and this lead to Norton Editor, Norton Guides, and Norton Commander being made in 1985 and 1986. In August 1990, the higher-ups of the Norton company sold the company to Symantec for $70 million, therefore he was hired by Symantec Antivirus-kun... or well, "hired".</p>
					<p>The merger introduced Norton to malware challenges, initially struggling but eventually creating the NAV gun for effective defense. Symantec Antivirus-kun disappeared in 1998 despite being his tutor with dealing with malware, even thiugh Norton was not good at it at first. From 2000 onwards, Norton faced criticism for system performance impact, cooperation with the FBI, faulty updates, and ethical concerns.</p>
					<p>In 2007, Norton upgraded to Norton 360, evolving into NAV-N360. Acquisitions by the parent company resulted in Norton living with three sisters - Avast, AVG, and Avira - collectively combating malware despite Norton's tarnished reputation.</p>

                    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
                    <h3>Symantec Antivirus</h3>
                    <p>Symantec Antivirus, the man who had hired him. Symantec Antivirus ended up feeling like that Norton could do his job better and the higher-ups only added to this feeling when SAM was renamed Norton AntiVirus (NAV) for Macintosh.</p>
                    <p>Norton feels bad about Symantec Antivirus being replaced by him but doesn't know his whereabouts after he disappeared in 1998.</p>

                    <h3>Avast, AVG and Avira</h3>
                    <p>Avast, AVG and Avira are considered to be Norton's stepsisters, noting that their parent companies had been either brought or merged with Gen Digital.</p>

                    <h2>Abilities</h2>
                    <p>Despite being a man of multiple talents, he is well known for being able to recover data that had been deleted or erased, assisting DOS-tans (mainly MS-DOS) in finding stuff and fighting malware.</p>
                    <p>He also wields the NAV-N360, a rifle he uses for fighting malware. The name is a combination of Norton AntiVirus and Norton 360. It used to be called NAV until he upgraded it to have more powers.</p>
