        <h2>Character</h2>
        <p>Amiga-kun wears a white button-down shirt with green pants, a brown belt, a red tie, a green and orange plaid vest, red and white sneakers, long red socks, a blue and black hat, and orange hair tied in a long braid with green eyes. This is the clothes that he chose when the Vintage Federation was established and he had finally settled after having to jump from company to company to escape dying after the Commodore Fleet collapsed.</p>
        <p>The Amiga platform was innovative with excellent graphics, sound, and video capabilities that distinguished it from other personal computers of the period. Amiga-kun represents the Amiga's creative potential and multimedia power, emphasizing its ability to tackle multimedia tasks with ease.</p>
        <p>Commodore Amiga-kun is well aware of the challenges that afflicted the Commodore brand. He understands the issues stemming from mismanagement and rushed product releases. Moreover, he acknowledges that despite the Commodore Amiga's remarkable technical achievements, it faced commercial setbacks and did not attain the success it deserved even though the other Commodores don't think he does. Despite these challenges, Commodore Amiga-kun remains optimistic about the future. He believes that the Commodore Amiga can be a force for good in the world, hoping to inspire others to learn about the Commodore Amiga and to appreciate its many contributions to computing.</p>

    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
    <h3>Commodore-tans/kuns</h3>
    <p>Commodore Amiga-kun shares a nuanced relationship with the other Commodore computers. While deeply rooted in the Commodore family, Amiga-kun takes pride in its heritage and considers himself an integral part of the lineage. He holds a deep admiration for his fellow Commodore computers, recognizing their pioneering spirit and significant contributions to computing history.</p>
    
    <h4>Commodore PET</h4>
    <p>Commodore PET-kun is one of the oldest Commodore computers. He may be seen as a relic by some, but he is also a pioneer who helped to pave the way for the Amiga and other later computers. PET-kun is proud of his accomplishments and is always happy to share his knowledge with others. Amiga-kun often finds PET-kun's silly antics to be endearing, while PET-kun finds Amiga-kun's energy and enthusiasm to be refreshing. Despite their differences, they are close friends. PET-kun offered him words of encouragement when Amiga was feeling discouraged by his lack of success. PET-kun reminded Amiga that he is a talented person and that he could achieve anything he set his mind to.</p>
    
    <h4>Commodore 64</h4>
    <p>Commodore Amiga-kun admires Commodore 64-kun for his popularity and his role in popularizing home computing, yet still has complicated feelings towards him as the Commodore 64 was a massive commercial success, while the Amiga was never able to achieve the same level of success.</p>
    
    <h4>Commodore 128</h4>
    <p>They have very different personalities. Commodore Amiga-kun is a lively and outgoing character, while Commodore 128-tan is more kind and more mature. Amiga-kun often looks to C128-tan for advice admiring C128-tan's wisdom and experience. C128-tan is always happy to help Amiga.</p>
    <p>When Amiga-kun was feeling discouraged about his lack of commercial success, 128-tan reminded him of all the positive things he had accomplished. C128-tan helped Amiga-kun to see that he was still a valuable member of the Commodore family.</p>
    
    <h4>Commodore VIC-20</h4>
    <p>Amiga-kun is often exasperated by VIC-20-tan's hotheaded and aggressive behaviour, but he also respects her for her passion and determination. She is not afraid to speak her mind about him, even if it means offending him.</p>
    
    <h4>Commodore Plus/4</h4>
    <p>Amiga-kun often takes the lead when they are together. He is always looking for new things to do, and he is always up for a challenge. Plus/4-tan is more than happy to follow his lead, and she enjoys learning new things from him, even though she feels inferior to Commodore Amiga-kun, who was more successful in terms of sales.</p>
    <p>Amiga-kun is also impressed by Plus/4-tan's dedication to office work who is always willing to put in extra hours to get the job done, and she never gives up on a challenge, even if the built-in office software is limited.</p>
    
    <h4>AMIX-tan</h4>
    <p>Despite what others claim, AMIX was never really mean towards Amiga-kun. AMIX-tan is impressed by Amiga-kun's creativity and vision.</p>
    
    <h4>Atari ST-tan</h4>
    <p>Former rivals, Amiga-kun never really wanted to fight her mainly because Amiga-kun himself used to be part of Atari and because he was never really much of a fighter. The relationship between Commodore Amiga-kun and Atari ST-tan is a complicated combination of competitiveness, admiration, and mutual respect. Loren and Stacy were frequently compared and pitted against one another by their respective faction's leaders and higher-ups as two competing platforms in the computer industry throughout the 1980s. On the one side, there was rivalry between Commodore Amiga-kun and Atari ST-tan, as both systems sought domination and popularity among users.</p>
    <p>However, underneath the surface of rivalry, there was mutual appreciation and respect between the two characters. They were aware of each other's technical capabilities and distinctive features. Commodore Amiga-kun recognized Atari ST-tan's incredible MIDI capabilities, which helped her become a well-known singer. Similarly, Amiga-kun's strong graphics and multimedia capabilities were recognized by Atari ST-tan, making it a preferred platform for artists, designers, and gamers. Despite their conflict, Commodore Amiga-kun and Atari ST-tan occasionally found common ground. In areas of common interest, they occasionally complied or shared ideas.</p>
    
    <h4>Sage IV-tan</h4>
    <p>Sage IV-tan could be considered one of Loren's first proper memories, being the mother to him. Loren hasn't seen Sage IV-tan for a long time however.</p>
    <p>Sage IV also had to raise money to support him by designing and selling both joysticks and game cartridges.</p>

    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <p>Loren wields a sniper rifle however it is not very practical since it only shoots plungers. He’s also fluent in Spanish noting to how Amiga means “Female friend” in Spanish.</p>
    <p>Reflecting the Amiga's graphics capabilities, Amiga-kun possesses a unique talent for manipulating and controlling visual elements. He can create mesmerizing visual effects, distort reality, and employ visual illusions to gain an advantage in battle. his mastery of graphics gives them an edge in confusing opponents and altering the perception of their surroundings.</p>
