            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Born in The Infinite Loop, Sean's early days were loving and nurturing by his mother, Stephanie. However, he was marked by physical and mental challenges. Despite the gentle and caring nature of his mother, Sean faced structural fragility, both in terms of physical health and mental well-being. Even though he was born to be a businessman, he felt like his purpose was taken from him by his sister because of his troubled birth. Not only was his body fragile, but he was also prone to not being able to control his fire powers and could not read a clock properly. His outfit consists of a brown vest, a tan long-sleeved shirt, a beige cape, black jeans with rips in them and black shoes.</p>

            <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
            <h3>Apple I-tan</h3>
            <p>Apple III-kun often thought about her, and he wished that she was still there when she disappeared but knew that she would want him to be happy, and he tried to live his life in a way that would make her proud. He blamed himself for her disappearance, and he felt like he had let her down but slowly came to terms with Apple I-tan's disappearance. He realized that he could not blame himself for what happened.</p>
            
            <h3>Apple II-tan</h3>
            <p>Since businesses used the Apple II which is what the III was created for, he sometimes feels like she stole his purpose even though she tries to reassure him.</p>
            
            <h3>Lisa-tan</h3>
            <p>Sean doesn't think much of Lisa.</p>

        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_III#Design_flaws">  Many Apple IIIs were thought to have failed due to their inability to properly dissipate heat. inCider stated in 1986 that "Heat has always been a formidable enemy of the Apple ///", and some users reported that their Apple IIIs became so hot that the chips started dislodging from the board, causing the screen to display garbled data or their disk to come out of the slot "melted".By 1994, only Commodore's operations in Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom were still profitable. Commodore announced voluntary bankruptcy and liquidation on May 6, 1994</a></li>
