                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Martina's trusty assistant, she acts as Martina's maid even though that is not much of her job.
                        She wears a mandarin-collar suit ensemble that is Go Ben <span class="color-box"
                            style="background-color: #7b734f;"></span>(#7b734f) and Edward <span class="color-box"
                            style="background-color: #a1aca6;"></span> (#a1aca60) pinstripe coloured print fabric, a
                        black and grey badge on the suit which contains the text "EXORciser" and Copper Rust <span
                            class="color-box" style="background-color: #7e464f;"></span>(#7e464f) coloured buttons. She has long <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #928a66;"></span> Clay Creek coloured hair.</p>
                    <p>She worked with other characters like Amiga-kun when he was younger, Apple Lisa-tan, Atari ST-tan
                        and some of the early Macs.</p>
                    <p>She tends to be serious most of the time but is very loyal to Martina, refusing even to leave her
                        side after the AIM alliance fell along with a mess of other stuff. EXORciser-tan is dedicated to
                        the task of hardware testing and diagnostics and saw some of the major computer-tans/kuns come
                        into existence,</p>
                    <p>Most of her life is often being with Motorola DynaTAC-tan or doing duties at the Retrograde
                        Conglomerate such as household chores.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
                    <h3>Martina</h3>
                    <p>The relationship between Motorola EXORciser-tan and Martina can be described as a
                        unique blend of professionalism, mentorship and mutual respect. Despite Martina being younger than EXORcier-tan, Martina acts as a mother figure towards her and their relationship goes beyond mere age dynamics.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Abilities</h2>
                    <p>She has extensive knowledge what she can do with her powers so she can identify and resolve
                        conflicts between characters. Because she can debug, she can also exploit this ability if she
                        was stuck in a fight by using "Debugging Strike", allowing her to deliver precise strikes that
                        target vulnerabilities or weaknesses in her opponent's defenses if they are based on her code,
                        effectively disabling or neutralising their abilities.</p>
                    <p>Code manipulation is another power she can use to manipulate the digital code that makes up her
                        opponent's abilities, altering or disrupting them to gain an advantage in combat.</p>
                    <p>Although she has this ability she has to be cautous with it. Without proper focus she could
                        easily kill someone when trying to help them as her powers are very... <i>powerful.</i></p>

                                Motorola 6800, which mentions of the Motorola EXORciser.</a></li>

                        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VERSAdos#EXORmacs">VERSAdos Wikipedia page mentions
                                of the EXORmacs</a></li>

                        <li>She represents both the EXORciser and EXORmacs debugging systems as they are the same in a
                            way. The EXORmac was a follow-up system for M68000 processors as the EXORciser was used for
                            the M6800.</li>

                        <li>EXORciser being a maid of sorts is a reference to how there is a function known as <a
                                href="http://www.bitsavers.org/components/motorola/6800/exorciser/M6809EXOR_M6809_EXORciser_Users_Guide_Sep1979.pdf">MAID
                                (Motorola Active Interface Debug)</a> which is mentioned on page 5-2. I presume these
                            are debugging commands of sorts.</li>

                        <li>EXORciser is similar to Jango Fett from Star Wars in regards to the Clone Wars as the
                            Motorola EXORciser was a desktop computer built with the M6800 ICs that could be used for
                            prototyping and debugging new designs, and the same for the Motorola EXORmacs (it emulated a
                            680xx processor in-circuit but it still sped up development of 680xx based systems). Many
                            computers like the Amiga, Macintosh and Altair 680 used either a Motorola 6800 or Motorola
                            68000.</li>
