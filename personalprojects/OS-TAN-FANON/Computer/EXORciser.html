        <h2>Character</h2>
        <p>Martina's trusty assistant, she acts as Martina's maid even though that is not much of her job. She wears a mandarin-collar suit ensemble that is Go Ben <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #7b734f;"></span>(#7b734f) and Edward <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #a1aca60;"></span> (#a1aca60) pinstripe coloured print fabric, a black and grey badge on the suit which contains the text "EXORciser" and Copper Rust <span class="color-box" style="background-color: #7e464f;"></span>(#7e464f) coloured buttons.</p>
        <p>She worked with other characters like Amiga-kun when he was younger, Apple Lisa-tan, Atari ST-tan and some of the early Macs. She also represents the EXORmacs debugging systems, a follow-up system for M68000 processors as the EXORciser was used for the M6800.</p>
        <p>She tends to be serious most of the time but is very loyal to Martina, refusing even to leave her side after 68k machines became redundant and the AIM alliance fell. She has extensive knowledge of the Motorola 6800 and the 68k architecture which allows her to identify and resolve conflicts between characters. She employs various tools and techniques to track down and fix these issues.</p>
        <p>EXORciser-tan is dedicated to the task of hardware testing and diagnostics and saw some of the major computer-tans/kuns come into existence, gaining a deep understanding of microprocessors and the critical role they play in computer systems.</p>

        <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
<h3>Motorola DynaTAC-tan</h3>
        <p>The relationship between Motorola EXORciser-tan and Motorola DynaTAC-tan can be described as a unique blend of professionalism, mentorship, and mutual respect. EXORcier-tan saw DynaTAC-tan's birth.</p>
        <p>Despite DynaTAC-tan being younger than EXORcier-tan, DynaTAC acts as a mother figure towards her and their relationship goes beyond mere age dynamics.</p>
        <p>DynaTAC-tan's experience and knowledge in the realm of mobile telecommunications serve as a foundation for her mentorship. She understands the challenges and intricacies of the ever-evolving mobile technology landscape and imparts her wisdom to EXORciser-tan.</p>
        <p>EXORciser-tan, in turn, greatly admires and respects DynaTAC-tan for her expertise and accomplishments. She sees DynaTAC-tan as a role model, not only for her technical prowess but also for her leadership and poise.</p>
		<h3>Other Motorolas</h3>
        <p>EXORciser hasn't really met the newer Motorolas.</p>

        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <p>She has extensive knowledge of the Motorola 6800, 68000 and 68k architecture which allows her to identify and resolve conflicts between characters, giving her the innate ability to analyze complex code, pinpoint errors, and devise solutions to fix them. She employs various tools and techniques to track down and fix these issues.</p>
        <p>However because she can debug, she can also exploit this ability if she was stuck in a fight by using "Debugging Strike", allowing her to deliver precise strikes that target vulnerabilities or weaknesses in her opponent's defences if they are based on the Motorola 6800 or 68000, effectively disabling or neutralizing their abilities. Code manipulation is another power she can use to manipulate the digital code that makes up her opponent's abilities, altering or disrupting them to gain an advantage in combat.</p>
