        <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
        <h3>Commodore-tans/kuns</h3>
        <h4>Commodore Amiga</h4>
        <p>As a fellow member of the Commodore Fleet, Miyuki maintains a close relationship with Commodore Amiga-kun. Amiga-kun often looked to her for advice, admiring C128-tan's wisdom and experience. C128-tan is always happy to help Amiga.</p>
        <p>When Amiga was feeling discouraged about his lack of commercial success, C128-tan reminded him of all the positive things he had accomplished. C128-tan helped Amiga-kun to see that he was still a valuable member of the Commodore family.</p>

        <h4>Commodore PET</h4>
        <p>Their relationship is characterized by a balance of admiration and collaboration. Commodore 128-tan acknowledges the groundwork laid by Commodore PET-kun and values his wisdom and expertise. She appreciates his willingness to share knowledge.</p>
        <p>Commodore PET-kun, in turn, takes pride in seeing the progress made by the other Commodores and is delighted to witness the capabilities of the Commodore 128. He sees her as a testament to the evolution and growth of Commodore computers.</p>

        <h4>Commodore 64</h4>
        <p>Commodore 128-tan and Commodore 64-kun share a unique relationship due to the Commodore 128's compatibility with the Commodore 64 software. Despite being younger than Commodore 64-kun, Commodore 128-tan affectionately refers to him as "Young Commander" or simply "Commander" in a teasing manner to embarrass him in front of ZX Spectrum-tan. It's a playful way for her to acknowledge his status as a predecessor and to lightly poke fun at their age difference.</p>

        <h4>Commodore VIC-20</h4>
        <p>Their differences in personalities can sometimes lead to conflict between the two. Commodore VIC-20-tan can be quite blunt and outspoken, which can sometimes rub Commodore 128-tan the wrong way. However, they also have a lot of respect for each other. C128-tan prefers to approach conflicts with a calm and measured tone, seeking to understand different perspectives and find common ground. This stark difference in temperament between Commodore 128-tan and VIC-20-tan can lead to disagreements and clashes of opinions.</p>

        <h4>Commodore Plus/4</h4>
        <p>Commodore 128-tan's relationship with Commodore Plus/4-tan is a mix of understanding and frustration, particularly when it comes to the limitations of Commodore Plus/4's built-in office software. As a versatile and resourceful character, Commodore 128-tan acknowledges the capabilities of the Commodore Plus/4-tan and recognizes its contributions to the Commodore lineup. However, she also acknowledges the limitations of the built-in office software on the Plus/4.</p>
