                      Woody Brown coloured hair.
            </p>
            <p>
              While Mikko Idestam's tall stature may initially give off an
              intimidating impression, she is far from evil or scary. She's
              respectful, honest and endowed with courage, energy, has a strong
              will and is inclined to think that anything she can do, others can
              too. Despite her feminine qualities Mikko is sometimes mistaken
              for a male however she embraces her unique appearance and takes
              pride in challenging gender stereotypes.
            </p>
            <p>
              She was confident and proud when she made her debut and was known
              for being friendly enough that she helped humans with recycling
              efforts. Mikko was also ahead of others during her time with how
              she presented herself and was seen as the number-one amongst her
              peers, even though she was not the most technologically advanced
              it was enough to make her rivals a *bit* nervous. Most of her life
              was as a nomad away from her parent faction's location and instead
              spent more of her time elsewhere with other computers from her
              time (and some before it) because of her specialised role of
              industrial data collection which required her to endure harsh
              environments...
            </p>
            <p>
              Until her parent faction sold off the section she was part of to
              another faction, who in turn ended up shutting down the area where
              she lived, screwing her over and leaving her not only with a sense
              of feeling lost at times but also a little feeling of betrayal.
            </p>

            <h2>Family and Relationships</h2>
            <h3>Other Nokias</h3>
            <p>
              MikroMikko-tan is a bit of a loner. She never really got close to
              the other Nokias because she worked away from them so she was
              separated. She met other computers there who had been there since
              the 1960s, and she felt more at home with them than with the other
              Nokias.
            </p>
            <p>
              She also never got a chance to meet some of the other Nokias until
              years later, sometime after her parent faction sold off the
              section she was part of to another faction. By that time she was
              already a bit of an outsider and she never really felt like she
              fit in with the other Nokias.
            </p>

            <h3>Nokia 80 and Nokia MPS10</h3>
            <p>
              It is said that Nokia 80 made their debut years before Mikko and
              was an inspiration to her whereas Nokia MPS10 was assigned to work
              with her on some tasks with networks and banks.

            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>
              Like most others part of her faction Mikko is strong and can fight
              with her bare hands as her outfit protects her. She wields a large
              long shield and is mainly on the defensive side of things.

                Nokia 80 and Nokia MPS10 having some sort of relation to her is

                had MikroMikko 2s

                The whole recycling stuff along with her being friendly is a
                refernece to how it is said to be the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikroMikko"
                  >first environmentally friendly computer</a
                >. The same source talks about how in most cases it was not the
                most technologically advanced, but even these features it
                breathed down the necks of its competitors in close proximity &
                in the early 90s, the MikroMikko was ahead of others in terms of
                design.
              </li>

              <li>
                Mikko being around her home faction then needing to move
                elsewhere is a reference to how
                <a
                  href="https://www.net.fujitsu.fi/fi/historia/mikrotietokone/mikromikkohistoria/index.html"
                  >MikroMikkos were originally made in the Kutomotie factory</a
                >
                but due to the delivery volumes of MikroMikko increasing, the
                capacity of the Kutomotie factory began to become insufficient.
                The Kilo computer factory in Espoo was established on 23
                September 1985. Said factory was shut down around 1999 or 2000,
                some years after ICL brought the computer line from Nokia.
              </li>

              <li>
                Mikko also being friendly is a reference to how
                <a
                  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120623131656fw_/http://koti.mbnet.fi/~oju/retro/Mikko_eng.html"
                  >the computers were especially designed for good ergonomy. The
                  keyboard has a built-in wrist support and a very slow screen
                  that is very comfortable even though it has a 50Hz refresh
                  rate.</a
                >
                The same source says the computer's keyboard is 2KG, hence why
                she has a shield and is more defensive than offensive.
