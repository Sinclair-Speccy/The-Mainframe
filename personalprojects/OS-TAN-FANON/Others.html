            The <i>other</i> misc characters
          </h2>
          <p>
              While yes a page for misc characters does exist this page is meant to accompany it or something by serving a list of characters who do exist with enough characterisation, but not enough written to have their own page as of yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made this page to save a bit of time because I have many other characters who do exist, but I am yet to revamp each one so I can make seperate pages for each one...

        <p>There are several other characters who exist for the other iPhone models so this will be formatted as a list</p>
        <ul>
            <li>iPhone 3G/3GS: Jasper Ive is known as being one of the more well-known iPhone characters I have created. Her attire consists of black boots, dark grey pants and a belt, a light grey long-sleeved shirt, a dark grey vest that is undone, and a purple tie along with a black cape. On the right side of her vest is a purple Apple logo to represent the original iPhone 2G and at the end of the vest are two home buttons. 3G-tan has purple eyes and black hip-length hair. Despite fighting in the Smartphone Wars she tries to stay humble, but ends up more rude or snarky and dislikes the Wall Garden. She gets along well with Sochi and even supports things like jailbreak, trying to keep up with the times but questioning what her existence really is worth. Due to a screw-up when creating Jasper Ive, I used purple instead of blue because of how the original iPhone had the codename of "Purple", hence her eyes and some of her clothes being purple.</li>
            <li>iPhone 4/4S: Sochi Ive on the other hand unlike Jasper is more innocent and less tomboyish. She tries to keep an innocent and cutesy image up but this is a trap more than anything to hide how strong she is. Her attire consists of a white dress with long sleeves, buttons down the front, a high collar and a flared skirt along with a white hat with a black band. She is a magic user and welds a staff but can get really snarky at times as more of an insult to people who underestimate her abilities. Sochi could also be seen as the mediator for Jasper at times.</li>
            <li>iPhone 5/5C/5S: Elise Ive is known as the "bird lady" and gets stuck in the middle of arguments, having to stop them from happening due to the iPhone 5 having iOS 6 and the 5s and 5c having iOS 7, so very different OSes that went from skeuomorphism to the flat design. She is a magic user like Sochi but takes advantage of having wings which are rainbow (based on the iPhone 5c colours) to fight, despite not being much of a fighter and preferring to stay passive. She gets along well with Bursa Ive. Elise wears a dark grey dress with a frilled hem, boots and bracelets.</li>
            <li>iPhone SE (all gens): Frisco Ive is the sporty like character based on the fact the original iPhone SE was pretty much a iPhone 5 with the innards of a 6s including the Apple A9 system-on-chip and greater battery capacity. The only real distinct part about Frisco is the fact she has a super long braid and is one of the few iPhone characters based on the Product RED iPhones, though this did not come until later with the 2nd gen of the SE. She is capable of lifting things that could be seen a difficult for others... like eMacs. Frisco doesn't use weapons and prefers to fight with her fists and wears a red jacket and pants with a golden belt.</li>
            <li>iPhone 6/6 Plus/6s/6s Plus: Bursa Ive is one of the few characters who has a different body type, that being more endomorph. In a sense she is more chubby compared to others like Sochi and Elise but is taller anyway.. Despite being one of the best selling iPhones she doesn't take it for granted and thinks it is a curse, and is perhaps a bit of a coward and a ditz. She suffers from back problems in a reference to bendgate and gets along well with Elise and Frisco. She is also cursed with people being such big fans of her she still gets updates (the 6/6 plus and 6s/6s plus got updates for 8 years, the latest one being iOS 15.8.3 which was released on July 29, 2024. Her attire is based on the rose gold iPhone 6 model so she wears a long pink dress with grey boots.</li>
            <li>iPhone 7/7 Plus:</li>
            <li>iPhone 8/8 Plus:</li>
            <li>iPhone 11/11 Pro/11 Pro Max:</li>
<p>For iPhones that are not listed here, it is due to them not having a character yet or they are being reworked. There is more to add here anyway...</p>
