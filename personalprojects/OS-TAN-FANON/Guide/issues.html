                <h2>Issues with the current state of the fandom</h2>
                <p>Now OS-tans have been around for a loooong time now, let alone the concept of OS-tans before people even bothered to call them OS-tans dates way back to the 90s with characters like Win-chan or Magical Toko. I'm not gonna go over the history of OS-tans here because there are other places that do this but they've been long around enough to have reached the west, which led to the creation of OS-tan Collections.</p>
							
				<p>While back in the day it did have good intentions and success due to being the only other place outside of Japan nowadays it has become a relic of the past that still has dominance due to a centralisation issue this place has. OSC was for a long time the only known part of the Western fandom, so much that their wiki is still seen as <i>the</i> OS-tan wiki to some people so there was a monopoly. Of course this is just one of the many issues...</p>
                            
                            <p>What sill be written here are in dropdowns due to how long some of them are :P</p>
                            
                            <section>
                                <h2>Canon, fanon and all that crap!</h2>

    
<button id="toggleCanonFanonButton">Click to Toggle Issue 1</button>
                                
<div id="canonFanonContent" style="display: none;">
    <p>What people may know as "canon" are the Futaba and Madobe universes but there is no real canon. What you are actually seeing are the more "accepted" designs from Futaba Channel's <a href="https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/v3/download/matrix.org/bKhdpIFbanKbOhivtZLMZZDc?allow_redirect=true">"2D back" imageboard</a>. <a href="https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/v3/download/matrix.org/zSGloJkqbHhbEGMRjlwTXrZJ?allow_redirect=true">OS-tans are characters that everyone has created and "raised" by Toshiaki (so-called nameless, pretty much anons like on 4chan) on Futaba Channel</a>.</p>

    <p>In fact, the design of the 2000 can be said to have <a href="https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/v3/download/matrix.org/rHypcOYnTYNYXXPFVuARYPxC?allow_redirect=true">multiple designers that contributed to her</a> along with <a href="https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/v3/download/matrix.org/ZFfMYomDqUgCGGTcHfdoPIMI?allow_redirect=true">98-tan and other characters</a> whose designers are unknown.</p>

    <p>It seems like that they were never meant to get really popular due to the threads on Futaba Channel disappearing once they were too old and characters were left up to interpretation by their creators intentionally by having vague, leaving others to put together ideas but they did get popular enough to end up in the west with <a href="https://www.ostan-collections.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">OS-tan Collections</a> being made where they attempted to build upon what Futaba Channel made with their "Annex" Project (it did not go well when you look back years later).</p>

    <p>We will most likely never see the original thread where ME-tan was shown for the first time, therefore we will never really know what was intended of her and whenever the info about her on other wikis is 100 correct besides details that seem consistent across artworks of them.</p>

    <p>Someone brought up to me the idea of "headcanons" and I feel that it applies to the Futaba Channel too. Since wikis aren't always 100 correct and the stated that it is not meant to really be accurate, what if the stuff there are just headcanons from other people?</p>

    <p>Although there are two main "canons", those being the Futaba Channel universe and the Madobe universe, there is no proper strict canon. It can be said that there are as many OS-tan worlds as there are artists. If you go to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040605110411/http://shinjuku.cool.ne.jp:80/heika_love/">archived version of Cool.ne.jp</a> and scroll down you will find this:</p>

    <blockquote>
        自作絵祭りの流れに乗って、もはや二次裏のスタンダードとなったOS娘ワールド。そのバリエーションは十人十様、まさに絵師の数だけOSたんワールドが存在しているともいえる。
        そして、その集大成とも言えるFLASHが完成！おなじみの「あの歌」にのせて、としあき達のOSたんが動く！さらにはクリックによる隠し要素も満載、としあきならずともFLASHファンなら必見のムービーです。
    </blockquote>

    <p>Which translates roughly to this:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Riding on the trend of self-made picture festivals, OS Girl World has now become the standard for secondary art. There are dozens of variations, and it can be said that there are as many OS-tan worlds as there are artists. And FLASH, which can be said to be the culmination of all of this, is completed! Toshiaki and his friends' OS-tan moves to the tune of the familiar "that song"! Furthermore, there are many hidden elements that can be clicked, making this movie a must-see for any FLASH fan.

                            <h2>Stop trying to find accurate information because it's pointless at this rate -_-</h2>

                                 <button id="toggleInfoButton">Click to Toggle Issue 2</button>

<div id="infoContent" style="display: none;">    
    <p>As you, the reader, may know, there are currently two major wikis about OS-tans, those being OS-tan Collections and OS-tans.moe respectively.</p>

    <p>You see, back in the day when the OS-tan boom was happening on Futaba, OS-tan Collections tried to gather information on them the best they could by relying mainly on art of the characters. At the time, this would have been doable, but as OSC's wiki aged, they started to mash this info about the Futaba characters into their own canon called “Annex” which was meant to build upon what Futaba had. This led to a mess because with everything being muddled up as one big mess of “canon” and the Annex project in one, no one is really going to know if what is written is true or not. Turn the clock to the 2020s and you’ll see that some pages link to another wiki known as “OS-tans.moe”.</p>

    <p>Now OS-tans.moe. I used to be here until I left but when I left, I did not think much of it. I thought “oh hey, at least there is a better place for information on the Futaba OS-tans unlike OSC which is a mess”. Flash forward to May 2024 and then there was a discussion in the r/OStan discord where it was said that Me-tan’s name really is not Emui but rather “Meko” along with a discussion with newly found information for XP-tan.</p>

    <p>The whole “Meko” name claims boil down to the fact that on Me-tan’s creator’s site there is art they did with some of them having “Meko” in the file name. Some of them also have “Metan”. This led to me wondering if the entry for her at the “@wiki”. This other wiki is what OS-tans.moe uses for their info on OS-tan which is called the “@wiki” on OS-tans.moe but the whole “@wiki” thing isn’t the wiki’s actual name, that's actually the software that is being used for the wiki similar to how you have MediaWiki for Wikipedia. The wiki itself is called "ふたば★二次裏@wiki" aka Futaba★Secondary Backstage@wiki. The "@wiki" part is what I assume an ending of sorts the software puts on the end of all the wikis as you can see more of these at the actual site for the @wiki (<a href="https://atwiki.jp/">https://atwiki.jp/</a>) but also the about page for the wiki itself:</p>

    <blockquote>
        そのためJavaScriptの使える@wikiを選びましたが使うためには管理権限が必要であり、他の人が作っているところでそれを要求するわけにもいかなかったので結局独自に作ることにしました。 
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        I wanted to use JavaScript to template the pages so that I could keep them in the same format as possible. Is. For that reason, I chose @wiki, which supports JavaScript, but in order to use it, I needed administrative privileges, and I couldn't ask for that when someone else was making it, so I ended up creating my own.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Anyway, back to Me-tan’s real name, I looked around her wiki page and translated stuff which showed that it had “Emui”, but no sources as to where this name came from. I'm starting to think that it might be a fan name people gave her at Futaba that latched on because the English long E sound is usually I in other languages, the E in "M.E" is pronounced as so, M is pronounced "Em" so in Japanese people turned it into "Emu" and then long E turns into "i".</p>

    <p>If Meko wasn't her actual name nor the name the creator endorsed... Why would her creator name her files "Meko" and why is it not mentioned on her creator’s site? Meko being her "name", even if it’s literally just Me-child, is most likely correct because no one knows where the whole Emui thing came from. The English wikis and I guess the Japanese wiki too pose this information as absolute information when it has never been verified when this is her name or not.</p>

    <p>Go forward to very early June and a group chat I am in were discussing stuff where I told the users there that 95-tan did some bad stuff to Reobo (Mac OS X Leopard-kun who looks like a child) which I felt should be mentioned in a content warning for one of the external links on his OS-tans.moe page as this was found on the @wiki page for Reobo. This information lingered around for a while until 6 days later when I was bored and looked around the @wiki itself. And whoop-de-doo it turns out that the information on the “@wiki” may not even be 100% correct itself despite coming from Japan itself! Why?</p>

    <p>On the about page for the @wiki it says this:</p>

    <blockquote>
        当wikiはふたば★ちゃんねるの二次裏のキャラや知識をまとめておくのを目的とします。しかしながら当wikiに書かれている記事が公式設定というものではなく、書かれていたから有効というものでもありません。
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        The purpose of this wiki is to summarize the characters and knowledge of the secondary backstage of Futaba★Chan. However, the articles on this wiki are not the official settings, nor are they valid just because they were written.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Let alone the wiki isn't even by Futaba themselves. It was made by one person who worked on a similar wiki that disappeared and wanted to not see their favorite pages disappear again:</p>

    <blockquote>
        これを作る以前は「ふたば★虹板Wiki企画」に二次裏キャラのページをいくつか寄稿していました。そこが急になくなったことで自分の記事が否定されたような気がして、心の中にモヤモヤとしたものを抱え込んでしまったので、最初はそれを晴らしたかっただけでした。
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Before making this, I had contributed several pages of secondary characters to the "Futaba★Nijiboard Wiki Project". When it suddenly disappeared, I felt like my article was being rejected, and I had a feeling of confusion in my heart, so at first, I just wanted to clear it up.
    </blockquote>

    <p>This made me realize that this information I found about 95-tan doing stuff to a character that looks like a kid may not even be correct or true, which to me leaves the question "Which wiki is more accurate?" The answer? I don't know anymore. OS-tan Collection’s wiki is already an aged mess of canon and fanon mixed in with one another and I presume that OS-tans.moe was unaware that this info may not be correct but took it anyway. Sure, OS-tans.moe may have sources unlike OS-tan Collections, but how accurate are those sources?</p>

    <p>I feel like while some info is correct, not all of it is, and I don't want people using OS-tans.moe, OSC, or Futaba★Secondary Backstage as absolute info on OS-tans but rather everyone could make their own interpretations of sort from art of them.</p>

    <p>Some people would most likely complain to me about saying that info isn't 100% correct but now I wonder if the OS-tans were ever meant to end up the way they did. It feels like to me that they were never meant to get really popular, and they were left up to interpretation by their creators intentionally by having vague info. We will most likely never see the original thread where ME-tan was shown for the first time, therefore we will never really know what was intended of her and whenever the info about her on other wikis is 100% correct. This links back to the first 1st issue because the threads disappear. </p>

    <p>Someone in the r/OStan Discord server mentioned that headcanons are good, which made a thing click in my mind in regard to the Futaba characters themselves because it feels like the concept of headcanons applies to the Futaba Channel characters as well. If they were meant to be well known, why is info about them hidden away?</p>

    <p>It feels like a tricky thing to deal with, such as telling certain people to not use certain characters (like what I kind of did with 95-tan before I found out the info may not be 100% correct) because literally anything about them could be a headcanon too, even from Futaba Channel themselves. I think aside from XP-tan because we found her creator's site that has info on her, info for the others from their creators is rare or vague. OS-tan Collections already tries to merge the existing Futaba characters into their own headcanon, which already makes me question the validity of it but at the same time we have never seen the Futaba Channel threads on these characters, we will never know what is right or wrong.</p>

    <p>One user on the Discord had complaints about 95-tan was that she is portrayed as stable but what if she was never really meant to be portrayed this way? What if this was really someone's headcanon for her? We have never seen the thread where she was introduced so we will never know.</p>

    <p>A lot of my thoughts about info not being one hundred percent correct boils down to the fact that we will most likely never see the threads and have to rely on what already exists like the @wiki itself, despite the fact it says info on there may not be accurate.</p>

    <p>Along with all of this, I use Japanese image sites to get more art on OS-tans when someone came to me and said, “but can you find something about her with a Japanese VPN though?” because I found SFW art of the Futaba Windows 2.0/2.1-tan. Even if I were to find information on them, there would be no way to verify if it was correct because it could literally be someone’s headcanon.</p>

    <p>Personally, I think we should stop trying to find accurate information because no matter what route we go, there will be no way to confirm the accuracy of it. The wikis are still valuable, but people should not assume they're 100% accurate as sources and the Futaba characters can be compared to characters from other series where a lot is left to interpretation such as Touhou or Vocaloid. The Futaba wiki could be storing the main details but even then, how are we going to know those are right if it says on the about page just because it was written, it may not be right?</p>

    <p>All that we can assume is right are consistent details such as Me-tan being buggy and etc.…</p>

                            <p>What I can say so far though is that there should be blend of what OS-tans.moe and OS-tan Collections did which is getting sources on characters but also observing the art made by the community to get a understanding of the Futaba characters. There's never gonna be absolute information asides from "this character is from Futaba" because some characters don't really have sources beyond "this character is from Futaba"!</p>
