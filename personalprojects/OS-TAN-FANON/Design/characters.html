                <h2>Sorry, OS-tans.moe</h2>
                <p>Some of the old stuff I said there is going to be moved over to here yet it is not like I am remvoing it from the "Guide for Crators" page. Ths page is a WIP anyway.</p>

                <h2>Le past</h2>
<p>A long time ago when I did first discover the concept of OS-tans, there were a lot of designs at a certain place. Some designs made sense such as Windows 1.0 (OSC's one), Apple Lisa, FreeDOS and some others. Why? These designs took inspiration from the thing they personify such as GUI colours and logos. However, depending on what was being personified some of them did not follow this like because of reasons such as the thing being personified did not have much colour like the mainframes or ignored most of it, like Commodore 64-tan's design which only used the BASIC screen colour for the eyes and hair.</p>

                <h2>"Salty" Sinclair Rant 101</h2>
<p>Everyone is allowed to have their own ideas but to me, I often wondered some things like why does Commodore 64-tan have an outfit that is no way similar to the beige colour of the computer or SAGE-tan (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) having colourful ribbons in her hair??</p>

<p>Point for me where the red and white checkered colours and blue for SAGE's outfit on the machine are.</p>

                <h2>How 2 design???</h2>
<p>When I design characters, I try to take colours from the GUI and wallpapers the OS/Computer/Whatever have. Examples include Jasper, Byt-8-kun, MikroMikko 1-tan and Motorola EXORciser-tan so pretty much the one iPhone design that is on the site as I write this and the 3 computers. There are sites out there that let you get hex colour codes from images but sometimes, this idea of getting colour codes can be limiting when you have products that are not from the same company or whatever...</p>

<p>Another thing I try to do is examine what I want to personify. Research is IMPORTANT to me so that means "abusing" search engines with my desired thing I want to personify. This can apply to Motorola EXORciser as finding images to design her outfit after was not easy when I made her for the very first time.</p>

<p>With examining what I want to personify, it helps with minor details on characters such as their outfits. A good example I can give of this is of Simon who has coloured patches on his suit which are derived from the weird coloured things you can see in the computer. I have no idea what these actually are.</p>
