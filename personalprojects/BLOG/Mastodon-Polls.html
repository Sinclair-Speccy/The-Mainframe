        <h1 class="title">Poll Analysis: Computers and
        Mastodon</h1>
        <p>Around December 17, 2024, I created a simple poll on
        Mastodon asking “How long have you been using computers
        for?” (You can view it <a href=
        "https://oldbytes.space/@SinclairSpeccy/113662681677892696">
        here</a>). I didn’t expect much from it as it was meant to
        be a general question about technology use. To my surprise,
        the poll blew up, getting over 252 boosts, 132 favorites,
        and plenty of engagement in the replies, including a
        suggestion to make a follow-up poll.</p>
        <p>This was not originally meant to be any means of
        research, but I suppose you can say it became a research
        opportunity about Mastodon’s user base. This got me
        thinking about why I started using Mastodon myself, but we
        will get to that part later as I don't want to add it to
        this right now. I should analyse the results first from
        each poll.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h1 class="title">Poll Results</h1>
        <p>The first poll was simple, asking users to share how
        long they’d been using computers. While yes, I am on a
        retro tech instance, I tried to get my poll further out
        into Mastodon outside of retro tech:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>60%</strong> of respondents reported having
          over <strong>30 years of computer experience</strong>,
          meaning they likely started using computers in the 1980s
          or earlier.</li>
          <li>Another <strong>16%</strong> indicated 30 years,
          while <strong>13%</strong> marked 25 years of
          experience.</li>
          <li>Only a small fraction, about <strong>12%
          combined</strong>, reported using computers for less than
          20 years.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These results showed that with the amount of people that
        voted on the poll, Mastodon’s audience consists of
        long-time tech users who have witnessed the evolution of
        computing from its earlier, pioneering days to the present.
        The overwhelming response of "even longer" suggests an
        audience that likely values the era of personal computing
        when systems like the Commodore 64, early Macs, or IBM PCs
        were household names.</p>
        <h2>Follow-up Poll</h2>
        <p>In the follow-up <a href=
        "https://oldbytes.space/@SinclairSpeccy/113705509782999197">
        poll</a>, I asked: “How old were you when you first started
        using a computer?” The results provided insights into when
        these experienced users were first introduced to
        technology:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>38%</strong> started using computers between
          the ages of <strong>5-10 years old</strong>, with
          <strong>28%</strong> starting at <strong>11-15 years
          old</strong>.</li>
          <li>A smaller but notable <strong>12%</strong> began
          under the age of 5, while <strong>11%</strong> started
          between 16-20 years old.</li>
          <li>Only a small percentage began after the age of 20,
          with <strong>7%</strong> at 21-30 years old and just
          <strong>5%</strong> over 30.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This poll focused on the relationship between age and
        computer experience. The younger age groups dominate, with
        38% of respondents beginning their computer usage between
        ages 5-10. The combined 5-15 years old group accounts for
        78% of the respondents, highlighting a strong correlation
        between childhood and early exposure to computers. In
        contrast, older demographics (over 21 years old) represent
        a smaller percentage.</p>
        <h2>Final Poll</h2>
        <p>To tie everything together, the <a href=
        "https://oldbytes.space/@SinclairSpeccy/113747321408593135">
        final poll</a> asked: “What decade did you first start
        using a computer?” The results once again skewed towards
        older tech users:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>57%</strong> started in the 1980s, a period
          marked by the rise of personal computing.</li>
          <li><strong>20%</strong> began in the 1990s, during the
          internet boom and the dominance of say Windows 95.</li>
          <li><strong>13%</strong> started in the 1970s or earlier,
          aligning with the earliest adopters of mainframes and
          early personal computers.</li>
          <li>The remaining 10% spanned the 2000s (9%), 2010s (1%),
          and 2020s (0%), showing the limited presence of younger
          or newer users on Mastodon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the 1970s or earlier, a small yet significant
        portion of the audience began using computers during the
        early days of computing. These users likely interacted with
        mainframe systems, early personal computers like the Altair
        8800, or institutional systems such as IBM mainframes.
        Their experience reflects firsthand exposure to the earlier
        technologies.</p>
        <p>For the 1980s, the majority of respondents entered
        computing during the personal computer boom. This era saw
        the rise of early home computers such as the Apple II, IBM
        PC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. It marked a period as
        computing moved from large institutions to homes and small
        businesses. These users were likely influenced by the
        emergence of iconic software like DOS and early graphical
        interfaces, such as Macintosh System 1 and Windows 1.0.
        This result aligns with previous polls showing that many
        respondents have over 30 years of computing experience.</p>
        <p>The 1990s group likely experienced the rise of Windows
        3.x, Windows 95/98 and the adoption of the internet. They
        might have started with mid-tier personal computers or were
        part of an educational or professional shift towards
        widespread computing. This group corresponds with the
        "11-15 years old" respondents from earlier polls.</p>
        <p>For the 2000s, these users were introduced to computing
        during the early 2000s, a time defined by Windows XP, the
        peak of the dot-com boom and the expansion of broadband
        internet.</p>
        <p>The 2010s represent a smaller but notable group that
        began using computers during the last decade, reflecting
        the modern "mobile-first" generation. Their experience
        likely revolves around tablets, smartphones, and cloud
        computing, moving away from traditional desktops or
        laptops.</p>
        <p>As expected, the 2020s or later garnered negligible
        responses, as Mastodon’s audience leans heavily towards
        older, tech-savvy users with extensive computing
        histories.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h1 class="title">The analysis</h1>
        <p>The responses from all polls showed that with the amount
        of people I reached, Mastodon seems to attract a
        demographic that skews heavily toward older, experienced
        tech users. Many of these people have been involved with
        computers for decades and appear to have nostalgia for the
        "golden age" of computing: a time when technology was more
        experimental, user-focused, and open.</p>
        <p>Across all polls there is a consistent theme of older
        users dominating the results. The majority of respondents
        report having over 30 years of computer experience,
        reflecting a strong bias towards individuals who were
        introduced to computing during the early days of personal
        computing or even earlier. Younger age groups represent a
        smaller portion of respondents, particularly those born
        after the 2000s, who show significantly less engagement.
        This suggests that Mastodon’s user base is skewed towards
        individuals who were active during the formative years of
        personal computing, the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
        <p>Please correct me if I am wrong with this because I
        researched beforehand, but in the past you could say the
        the tech industry was more open and experimental
        environment with a focus on user empowerment and
        innovation. However, over time, this has transformed into a
        landscape where major tech companies prioritise
        profitability, often at the expense of consumer interests,
        causing people who may be older to shift towards platforms
        like Mastodon. A notable development in this shift is the
        emergence of "walled gardens" such as Apple's walled
        garden, preventing things such as jailbreaking and the
        disappearance of personal websites (RIP Geocities).</p>
        <p>The first exposure to computers correlates with
        childhood and adolescence. A large percentage of
        respondents began using computers between the ages of 5-15,
        indicating that early familiarity with technology is a
        significant factor. In contrast, those who started using
        computers after their twenties are a smaller segment,
        supposedly showing Mastodon’s appeal to older users with
        extensive tech experience.</p>
        <p>It is important to note though that the total engagement
        across all three polls is 5,110 and Mastodon has over 10
        million registered users, so this only shows like a small
        fraction of Mastodon.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h1 class="title">Why Are Younger People Lacking in the
        Poll?</h1>
        <p>You could chalk it up to a few things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Platform Familiarity:</strong> Older users
          are more likely to seek out alternative platforms like
          Mastodon where they can find like-minded individuals who
          share their values around privacy, decentralisation and
          openness away from big corps and walled gardens as if
          Mastodon were to ever get brought, you could fork it
          anyway because it is open source. Younger generations,
          depending on what you class as "younger", are well
          established in mainstream social media ecosystems such as
          Instagram, TikTok or Twitter where the focus is often
          more on instant gratification, algorithms, and
          engagement-driven content. The reason why I say it
          depends on what counts as "younger" is because everyone
          has a different definition of it. I see people born in
          the late 2010s and onwards as younger but someone older
          might see me as younger.</li>
          <li><strong>Nostalgia and Ideals:</strong> Younger tech
          users may prioritize functionality and social
          interactions differently, possibly leaning toward
          platforms that cater to real-time communication and
          multimedia sharing over those focused on text-based,
          decentralized social experiences. The old web feels like
          a "retro aesthetic" to younger people rather than
          something of practical or cultural significance. They may
          not care as much about the backlash against algorithms
          and corporate practices of big social media
          companies.</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural Shifts:</strong> As technology
          evolves, younger users are exposed to new paradigms and
          trends that may conflict with or dilute the ideals of
          early personal computing. This shift might make platforms
          like Mastodon feel less relevant or appealing, especially
          if they don’t fully understand the historical context or
          the importance of community-driven alternatives.</li>
