      <h1 class="title">2022 in review: What in the state of confusion happened</h1>
      <p>As for whoever is reading this, I am sure 2022 was a wild mess. With the assassination of Shinzo Abe, Apple becoming the first company to reach a stock market value of $3 trillion and the UK had 3 PMs in two months surely no one expected this year to be a good one as 2021 and 2020 before were not fun with the pandemic along with other things. This year in review is sorted into each month however some months may have more information than others.</p>

      <h1 class="title">January</h1>
      <p>The new year with a side of not much hope. Since I am on the other side of the world I got to experience the new year before the Americans coukd, hah.</p>
		  <p>My new years resoluion? Well, I kind of hoped I could heal from some pain that happened a year ago. My mind essentially locked out most of this incident however.</p>
		  <p>2022 was also the beginning of when I needed to get my game on in school since I had reached the senior years. No slacking off! Unfortunately, this is what I did as my mental health began to fall again as the months passed. I was super hyped to do the psychology classes however.</p>

      <h1 class="title">April</h1>
      <p>Ahhh.. April. The month things began to get complicated. This was a month of looming anxiety, anger, frustration and confusion. This was the time when I did not anticipate dramatic change in the forcoming month. It also a month when I felt compelled to hate another person because a group hating them.</p>
		  <p>What happened? Well, all I can say is that conflicts happened while I was trying to reach out for help that was misinterpeted as me attempting to trigger another. Hatred for another person feulled me yet I never thought twice. I acted upon my people pleasing tendacies to have this group on Discord like me, not knowing the efforts would be useless later.</p>

      <h1 class="title">May</h1>
      <p>May was the month I had made this website. Anger was still clawing at my ankles. Days passed with my Discord DMs with another person full of pinned messages.</p>
		  <p>If you have ever gotten a puzzle piece and felt annoyed when a piece was missing, it kind of felt like this.It felt like I was talking to a soulless doll. All I really got was the same message written in different ways. My emotions.. changed. I was asking myself if trying to reach out for help in the first place was really worth it as all I recieved was punishment for such acts.</p>
		  <p>Further into May I began to ask myself "Is this hatred really worth it?". There was a growing feeling of conflict of interest. </p>
		  <p>"X being lonely is what they deserve and it is there own fault and not yours. No one is responsible for how X feels except X himself."</p>
		  <p>The conflict of interest grew from the fact this hated person taught me stuff other people didn't yet. It may have been executed badly, but that is besides the point.</p>
