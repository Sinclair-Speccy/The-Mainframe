                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Me-tan is the personification of Windows Millennium Edition. She is depicted as a cheerful yet accident-prone maid. She is one of the most popular OS-tans, often seen with a green onion (negi) as her item, inspired by a Japanese personal firewall named NEGiES. Her favorite food is a roll cake. Me-tan is also a 'punching bag character" meaning she is often portrayed as an idiot or natural idiot who fails to defrag, puts fried noodles in the sink and puts coke in the microwave. Emui is usually shipped with Mac OS 9-kun. Me-tan is clumsy and often crashes or freezes suddenly, reflecting the real-life instability of Windows Me. Despite her frequent failures, she remains cheerful, friendly, and optimistic. She is hardworking and always tries to help her master and family, though she often ends up causing frustration due to her unreliability.</p>

                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Me-tan has green hair in two parted braids with an ahoge, and green eyes. She wears a blue maid outfit with a white apron and a red-orange ribbon with an exclamation mark badge, symbolising a Windows error icon. Her design was inspired by Canal Vorfeed from the anime "Lost Universe."</p>
                    <p>According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book on August 6, 2003 when an image of the System Properties for Windows Me was posted, someone commented, "But Windows Me is cute even though it's no good." This highlighted Windows Me's human-like quality—cute yet clumsy, thus, lovable despite its flaws. It was suggested that Windows Me was not just an inorganic entity but had a human touch to it.</p>
                    <p>Toshiaki and others present agreed with this opinion. Following this trend, around 7 AM, two "Me personifications" were quickly improvised, marking the beginning of the larger "Futaba OS Personification" movement. The first one was a young girl with short hair with a shy or nervous expression, wide, round eyes and blush marks on her cheeks, hands clenched into small fists that are held close to her chest in a timid gesture and wearing a long-sleeved top. On her forehead the word "Me" is written along with the Windows Me logo.</p>
                    <p>The second one was a young girl with short red hair and a distinct, pointed strand sticking up from the top of her head, wears glasses, red eyes and has her hands clasped together in front of her. She is dressed in a white bikini with blue trim and ties with the word "Me" written on the bikini.</p>
                    <p>On Futaba Channel, when interesting material or ideas emerge from chats, replies, or posted images, they are not ignored. Instead, they are transformed into collages, drawings, joke replies, or comments, regardless of their quality or improvisation. This embodies the creative spirit of Futaba Channel, where spontaneous collaboration leads to significant trends, referred to as "festivals."</p>
                    <p>Just two hours after the first image was posted, around 9 AM on August 6, 2003, a pivotal illustration was created that would shape the future of "anthropomorphised" designs. This design featured green braided hair, stray hair strands, neatly trimmed bangs, a warning mark on the red bow and later in the morning, an apron dress with some refinements. This basic design of Me remains almost unchanged to this day.</p>
