            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>
              2K-tan, also known as Nisen, is the personification of Windows
              2000. She is portrayed as serious and competent, often acting as
              Me-tan's guardian and an older sister to XP-tan. Her reliable and
              professional nature makes her a key behind-the-scenes figure. She
              often acts like the older sister or dependable woman among the
              Windows-tans.
            </p>
            <p>
              She is positioned as a guardian or older sister of Me, and is
              often portrayed as a solid and serious character. She is also
              recognized by herself and others as a behind-the-scenes supporter
              and a career woman-like "reliable woman," so she is often placed
              in a disadvantageous role, and is a girl who is somewhat
              unfortunate because of her competence.

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
              2K-tan has short blue hair, glasses, and hairclips resembling cat
              ears flanking a small white bonnet or ruffle, which is a pun on
              "2K" (Ni-Ke in Japanese) sounding like "Nya-Ke" (meowing sound).
              She wears a swimsuit-like outfit in Windows logo colors with a
              blue long coat.
            </p>

            <p>
              According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book, the idea for a
              2k personification came out the same day Me-tan's was created at
              around 10am. The first design was a young girl with long hair that
              has a distinct, spiky strands sticking, has a confident expression
              with a slight smile and large, expressive eyes, wearing supposedly
              a hoodie with the text "2000" on it and is holding an open book.
              This original design looked nothing like the one we have now.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore around 10:30 AM, the "2K Personification" was created,
              completing the trio of main "Futaba OS Personification"
              characters. By the 8th, the "Windows 2K Personification" was
              finalised. This character featured a school swimsuit-inspired
              design with a coat and a short hairstyle. Additionally, heavy
              basic elements were added, along with a refreshing blue color
              scheme, establishing the association of "2K = blue." This
              solidified the basic design of the 2K character.

              She has an alt design which is more of like Inu-T-tan but instead
              a cat.
