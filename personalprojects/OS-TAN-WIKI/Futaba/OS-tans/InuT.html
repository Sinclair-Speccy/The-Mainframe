                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Inu-T is the personification of Windows NT 4.0 Workstation, often used to depict Windows NT in
                        general. She shares the role with NT-Mama and is known for her carefree and dog-like
                        personality. Inu-T is carefree, sweet, and spunky with an endearing dog-like attitude. She is
                        often portrayed as a comic relief character and is depicted as both daughterly and close with
                        NT-Mama.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Inu-T has blue hair kept in a ponytail that transitions to floppy dog ears, a dog's tail, and a
                        collar. She usually wears gloves and boots shaped like paws and a sleeveless light blue
                        one-piece dress.</p>
                    <p>There's sort of two stories about how she came about as the OS-tan fanbook and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181105162348fw_/http://www.geocities.jp/toshiaki_2004jp/nt/index.html">Monthy Futaba.</a> have something different.</p>
                    <p>Accordiing to Monthy Futaba, Inu-T came about sometime after the simple drawing for NT-Mama as amidst this, "Me-aki" introduced a dog-like NT character with the text "Dog ears + NT = Inuti... It was fun until I got home, right? Huh?". Artists such as "Unaaki" gradually developed this concept into "NT turned into a dog," which became the prototype for the later "Inuti." <a href="https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/v3/download/matrix.org/llVSrjcBpmGbXkyiRRBBBguJ?allow_redirect=true">This was the drawing by Me-Aki.</a></p>

        <p>A long time later, the name "Toshiaki" disappeared from the default names of Nijiura residents. New boards for original drawings and online characters were created. During this period, Inu-T once again came into the spotlight. As Nijiura was in a state of upheaval, people were saying, "It's more interesting to make something new than something boring; it's more Nijiura-like."</p>

        <p>Following this trend, "SRC Aki" posted several items on Nijiura, which were ranked 3rd. <a href="https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/v3/download/matrix.org/QPnIdDGDlVnJHAhrIFfQhnnM?allow_redirect=true">This was the drawing by SRC Aki.</a></p>
                    <p>According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book on June 22, 2004, a thread with the main text
                        consisting of just two words, "Dog Tei," suddenly appeared. The user asked if NT would look
                        dog-eared if she grew her sideburns longer. This quickly became a major topic in July 2004,
                        causing a flurry of activity among users. They were taken aback and exclaimed, "Wow! I don't
                        know," expressing their surprise and confusion at this unexpected development.</p>
                    <p>As a result, "Inuti" was treated as a separate character, independent of the original "NT Mama."

                    <h2>Notes and Trivia</h2>
                    <li>The name "Inu-T" comes from the romaji of NT ("enu-ti"), which sounds like "inu ti" ("inu" means
                        dog in Japanese).</li>
                    <li>Inu-T and NT-Mama coexist as the OS-tans of Windows NT, with Inu-T becoming the more popular
                        depiction in recent years.</li>
                    <li>The original drawing which was the basis for Inu-T looks similar to NT-Mama's design, just with
                        different hair and a different coloured bow which can be found in the Trouble Windows fanbook..
