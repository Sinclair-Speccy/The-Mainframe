            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>
              95-tan, also known as Windows 95-tan, is the personification of
              Windows 95. She is one of the most recognisable OS-tans and is
              considered one of the more stable OS-tans, but she is sometimes
              depicted wielding a katana aggressively towards Mac-tans, as well
              as troublemakers within her own family. 95-tan's most common
              activities include drinking tea, serving meals, and doing
              household chores. She struggles with newer technologies that
              emerged after Windows 95, such as USB devices and broadband
              internet connections. She has a bitter relationship with Kapone
              and although things have calmed down a bit, the atmosphere is
              subtly tense when they are together.

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
              95-tan is a gentle-looking brown-haired woman in a pink kimono
              with a cherry blossom pattern, a hair ribbon in the four Windows
              colors, hakama, and geta sandals.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book in the later half
              of January 2004, the "95 Personification" debuted with the design
              of an elderly woman in a kimono, chosen to emphasise the OS's age.
              Initially intended as a grand festival celebrating "95
              Personifications," numerous users contributed various design ideas
              that were introduced to the community. However, this quickly
              devolved into chaos. Despite the foundational concept of 95, each
              interpretation varied significantly. Each image reflected distinct
              thoughts, leading to entirely different designs, settings, and
              community responses, causing widespread confusion. The message
              board became overwhelmed. Ultimately, another creator known as
              Shiruaki refined the original grandmother concept, starting from a
              shrine maiden-inspired rough prototype which was propsed along
              with the many 95-tan designs and incorporated elements of the
              PC-98 era cherry blossom wallpaper, ultimately settling on the
              design of a woman in a kimono.
