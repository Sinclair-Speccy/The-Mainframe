            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>
              NT-Mama, also known as NT-maman, is the personification of Windows
              NT 3.x and other NT releases before Windows 2000. She is often
              depicted as a maternal and protective figure for other Windows
              OS-tans, especially 2K-tan and Inu-T.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
              NT-Mama has purple hair tied in a ponytail with a blue or yellow
              ribbon, and blue or purple eyes. She typically wears a simple pink
              dress, sometimes with a long-sleeved shirt underneath and an apron
              over it. Her design varies, but she is often depicted as a young
              woman with a maternal demeanor.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book although some
              personifications of Windows NT were created during the first
              festival in August 2003, they were almost forgotten. On December
              29, 2003, when the topic "Oh, what is NT?" came up, users recalled
              a simple design drawn on August 28, 2003. The reaction was, "Well,
              that's fine," and it stuck. This casual acceptance is part of the
              unique vibe of Futaba Channel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, since NT is the foundation for both 2K and XP, she was
              depicted as the mother of 2K and XP, with more mature proportions
              and form. This character became commonly known as "NT Mama." Had
              this trend continued, NT would have been firmly established as a
              mother figure.

              Often depicted with 95-tan, as they are shown to have trained and
              fought together in the OS Wars.

            <h2>Notes and Trivia</h2>
            <li>
              In some artworks, NT-Mama is portrayed as a bold warrior wielding
              a broadsword or rapier, contrasting with 95-tan's eastern blade.
            </li>
            <li>
              One set of artworks shows her in a military uniform, adding up to
              the claim that she may have partaken in the OS Wars with 95-tan.

              which was used for NT-Mama's design appears more childish and both
              the hair colour an bow colour are swapped. This design was by an
              artist called

              as someone suggested for them to draw an OS personification. After
              that, she was gradually given more personality and the image of a
              "kind mother," but her development stagnated due to her
              overlapping position with 95-tan.
