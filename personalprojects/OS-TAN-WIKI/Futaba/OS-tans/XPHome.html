                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Homeko is the personification of Windows XP Home Edition and the twin sister of XP Pro-tan. Her
                        character evolved from an early suggested design for XP-tan, which was later adapted for the
                        Home Edition. Homeko is characterized as a fujoshi (yaoi fangirl) who draws her own doujinshi
                        and has a strong interest in yaoi/BL media. She is often impulsive and lecherous, with an
                        intense imagination that sometimes annoys others. Homeko rarely goes outside except for
                        doujinshi sales and is sometimes depicted as slovenly with a large appetite similar to her
                        sister, Saseko.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Homeko has green hair worn in a short ponytail with large XP-shaped hairclips that cover her
                        ears. She is often depicted in a green-and-white tracksuit, referencing the Home Edition
                        packaging. Occasionally, she wears green cybernetic clothes, especially at conventions and
                        doujinshi events. Her original design was a"android-like" character that did not have a
                        distinctive personality.</p>
                    <p>According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book, Homeko's design is based on an earlier XP
                        design that was made in 2003 when the first designs for Me-tan and 2K-tan were created. Around
                        10:00 a.m., in response to the ongoing trend, a new "XP personification" appeared. This
                        character was depicted with an image of "cool and high performance," the opposite of Me. The
                        first XP personification, named "Home Edition," was initially treated as a "stepchild" of
                        Windows 2K due to its complicated design, making it difficult to draw.</p>
                    <p>On January 29, 2005, shortly after the design was named "HOME=Homeko," a thread appeared stating,
                        "I can't help but think of Homeko as a fujoshi who likes 801 doujin." Despite the unexpected
                        direction of the thread, the impact of this name led to a large-scale festival similar to the
                        one held for Inu-T.</p>
                    <p>While it might seem unimaginable, the peculiar nature of this phenomenon created a unique charm,
                        and the popularity of Homeko soared.</p>
