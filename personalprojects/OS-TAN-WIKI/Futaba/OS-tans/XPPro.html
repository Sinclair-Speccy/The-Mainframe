                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>XP-tan, also known as Saseko or Pekeppi, is the personification of Windows XP Professional Edition. She has a twin sister called Homeko, who personifies Windows XP Home Edition. Saseko is depicted as gentle and mild-mannered, with a gluttonous tendency due to the high memory requirements of Windows XP. Early portrayals depicted her as shallow and promiscuous, reflecting criticism of XP's "pretty" interface and security issues. Over time, her character has evolved to be more reliable and practical. She is also known for her compatibility mode, often cosplaying as other OS-tans.</p>

                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>XP-tan is a dark-haired girl with ribbons in her hair and an "XP" hair ornament on the left side. She usually dresses in a blue and white stylized schoolgirl outfit with ribbons and detached sleeves. Her design features a large bust and tight clothing, reflecting the early criticisms of Windows XP being resource-intensive and visually appealing without substantial utility. She has an alt design for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071216021347/http://www.geocities.co.jp:80/Playtown-Queen/5472/cpr/ga159.html">Windows XP Starter Edition</a>.</p>
                    <p>According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book during the same day Me-tan was made at around 11:00 AM, another "personification of XP" appeared. This version, with a calm atmosphere opposite to the first which Homeko's design is based on (who did not make her debut at that time), was well received. Then, her creator made their own design for XP who is a voluptuous dark-haired woman in a bikini top and skirt. At the same time, the additional setting of "memory usage IM size" was introduced, making it more convincing that XP, who consumes a lot of resources, would have a large bust. This decision was made spontaneously and in the heat of the moment.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the establishment of this setting, XP began to be portrayed as more glamorous, leading to the development of the "I hate big tits" theme. This idea fit well with XP's "specifications" as an OS known for consuming system memory unnecessarily.</p>
                    <p>On January 15, 2004, a new design for the XP personification appeared, conceived under the concept of "XP = after 2 weeks of service pack 2." The new design, a significant departure from the previous style, was well received by users, replacing the earlier design and becoming the standard look.</p>
                    <p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071216021347/http://www.geocities.co.jp:80/Playtown-Queen/5472/cpr/ga159.html">older version of her creator's site</a>, there is an explanation for how she was designed which is below:</p>
                    <ol>
    <li>The motif of the long black hair is the red XP letters (hair ornament) and the blue progress bar (ribbon) that stand out so prominently in the pitch black boot screen. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608145756/http://www.geocities.co.jp/Playtown-Queen/5472/cpr/ga140.jpg">This is it</a>.</li>
    <li>The jacket is drawn as if it is divided into a shirt and a vest, but it can be integrated or just color-coded.</li>
    <li>The overall blue is the color of the Professional package.</li>
    <li>The see-through sleeves are not very transparent. The white base color is about 65%. The origin is from the fact that XP can make the IME language bar translucent by setting. The reason why I designed the cuffs and shoulders to be opposite is because I was looking at the inverted suspension of a motorcycle and somehow thought...</li>
    <li>The size of the breast = the amount of memory installed.</li>
    <li>The personality reflects the original OS, of course: caring, nosy, and kind to beginners.... Although she thinks she is a solid person like 2k, she is a little natural and her overall movements are slow. Explorer often crashes when it encounters pornographic images (lol).</li>
    <li>I like to play with other OS's clothes (program compatibility mode), but I am a fastidious person and old erotic games don't work well.</li>
    <li>It is often said that "the character of XP is hard to understand", but the original OS itself is not distinctive, so I can't help it there.</li>
</ol>

                    <h2>Notes</h2>
                    <li>Her original nickname, Saseko, is derived from the letters X and P on the QWERTY keyboard mapping to さ (sa) and せ (se) on a Japanese kana keyboard.</li>
                    <li>The portrayal of XP-tan evolved to be more dependable after the release of Windows Vista and its higher hardware requirements.</li>
                    <li>Her creator also provided the "correct" way to draw her as a series of sketches which are here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130413135348im_/http://www.geocities.co.jp/Playtown-Queen/5472/cpr/ga114c.jpg">Image 1</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130413135348im_/http://www.geocities.co.jp/Playtown-Queen/5472/cpr/ga114b.jpg">Image 2</a>, & <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130413135348im_/http://www.geocities.co.jp/Playtown-Queen/5472/cpr/ga114a.jpg">Image 3</a>.</li>
