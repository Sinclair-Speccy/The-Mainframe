                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Windows 98-kun is the OS-kun personifying Windows 98, and the elder brother of 98-tan, 98SE-tan,
                        Me-tan, and Me-kun. He is also the younger brother of 95-tan and 95-kun, with the Windows NT
                        lineage, such as 2K-tan, being his half-siblings. Known for his serious yet laid-back nature, he
                        took on the alter-ego Masked Vulcan during the OS Wars, fighting actively. After the wars, he
                        worked as a pro wrestler but is now unemployed, living on an allowance from his grandmother.</p>

                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>98-kun is depicted as a young man in his mid-20s with black or brown hair, usually wearing casual
                        clothing like a t-shirt or a long sleeve black shirt with plain pants. He sometimes sports "98"
                        earrings or a "98" tattoo on his left shoulder. In his Masked Vulcan alter-ego, he wears
                        mech-like armor inspired by Kamen Rider, with a "98" logo and a long scarf.</p>
