            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
              Windows 95-kun is the OS-kun personifying Windows 95 and is the
              elder brother of 95-tan. Based upon various artworks and posts
              from Futaba, he is characterised as a middle-aged man with a
              stoic, gruff, yet laid-back personality, reminiscent of a samurai
              from the Edo Period. Despite his imperfections, such as drinking,
              95-kun is seen as a dependable and cool older brother. His sister
              is known to care for him, especially when he is down, showing a
              nurturing side.
            </p>
            <p>
              Old threads suggest different interpretations, one being that
              95-kun drinks a lot until very late at night and practices
              swinging a wooden sword early in the morning. He wakes up around 4
              or 5 AM to start his day, which begins with wooden sword practice.
              Despite his late-night drinking, he maintains a diligent routine.
              He goes to work in the fields until lunch, which usually consists
              of salted rice balls, teriyaki chicken, and miso soup with green
              onions brought to him by 95-tan. He continues working in the
              afternoon, takes a break with some mochi sweets and green tea, and
              finishes his work by sunset.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the evening, 95-kun provides kendo instruction at a nearby
              junior high school before returning home for dinner and drinks.
              Despite his regular alcohol consumption, he ensures all his
              responsibilities are met. He is known for his generosity, sharing
              the harvest and other resources with neighbors and the community
              at local festivals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another interpretation portrays 95-kun as a sake-loving individual
              who favors Ichitaro over foreign word processors like Word. He's
              known for his humor and laid-back demeanor, often using these
              traits to lighten situations, is frequently getting drunk and
              causing trouble at night with alcohol from unknown sources. While
              he fondly reminisces about the past he prefers living in the
              present, especially enjoying time with his younger siblings.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early mornings he practices sword fighting on his balcony,
              returning home from his part-time job to craft umbrellas. Despite
              his past involvement in wars and recurring nightmares, he rarely
              draws his sword, opting instead to combat viruses with the sheath
              or handle. His painful history includes a tragic love affair with
              an "apple girl, (likely a Macintosh reference), whom he was forced
              to kill by his father's orders (likely a reference to the OS
              wars). He has scars from his sword battles.
            </p>
            <p>
              His relationship with his siblings is complex; his sister wields
              her sword to fight others, contrasting with his decision to seal
              his own due to its lethal potential. 95 embraces enduring
              hardships without complaint, thinks it is important to cherish the
              present and the company of loved ones rather than dwelling on past
              sorrows. Under his cheerful character is a darker side, rooted in
              unresolved traumas and a reluctance to confront them. Despite his
              struggles, he finds it challenging to detach from those he cares
              about, even when it may be necessary.

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
              Based upon various artworks and posts from Futaba, he is commonly
              depicted in a pink men's yukata with geta or zori sandals, his
              hair styled in a samurai ponytail held by Windows-colored ribbons.
              The Windows logo prominently features on his yukata. He has brown
              hair and eyes, often with sideburns or stubble.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on the artist some artworks show him in a blue kimono
              and he can be seen with one of his arms inside his kimono,
              drinking from a wooden "cup" that is a square shape with the
              Windows logo on it.

                friendship with Akachochin.

              <li>
                His preference for Ichitaro is most likely Ichitaro, a Japanese
                word processor. As Windows became dominant, the market Ichitaro
                was in was largely taken over by Microsoft Word
