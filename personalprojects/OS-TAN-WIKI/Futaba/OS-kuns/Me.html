                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Windows Me-kun is the OS-kun personifying Windows Me and is the youngest of the Windows Family's
                        9x lineage. He shares a similar appearance with his sister Me-tan but is smarter and more
                        helpful, often found reading Windows Help files to others. He is portrayed as a student,
                        suggested to attend a local or private college, and sometimes as a boy detective.</p>

                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Me-kun is a mischievous schoolboy around 12-14 years of age. Despite his youth, he is mature,
                        helpful, calm, and rational. He is often seen engaging in academic pursuits or hanging around
                        with Homeo, 2K-kun, XP-kun, and Me-tan. He is very protective of his sister Me-tan and sometimes
                        interferes with her relationship with Mac OS 9-kun.</p>
                    <p>According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book, anthropomorphised OS characters are not
                        exclusively female. In February 2004, a male version of the anthropomorphized OS characters was
                        introduced. Initially, it was treated as a female type of the same, but as the character became
                        established, it was recognized as a brother and referred to as "OS son".</p>
                    <p>In addition to being called "OSたん", "OSタン", etc., it also started to be called "OS daughter" to
                        pair with the sons. By eventually gaining siblings. The anthropomorphised OS characters acquired
                        more human-like qualities and variations in their daily lives. This allowed them to break away
                        from the trend that had been biased towards the "weak two-sided" aspect centered on female
                        characters.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the existence of the son has played a role in gaining female supporters for the
                        anthropomorphized OS characters, such as original developments unique to the Futaba Yaoi board.
