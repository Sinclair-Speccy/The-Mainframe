                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Ōjiji is an OS-kun that personifies Windows 3.1 to 3.11. Based upon various artworks and posts
                        from Futaba, he maintains a serious demeanor and enjoys traditional Japanese activities such as
                        tea and rice crackers. Unlike his sister Ōbaba, he is accompanied by a DOS cat girl rather than
                        DOS Kitty. Ōjiji is portrayed as the elder brother of Ōbaba and Oichi, the older sibling of
                        NT-Mama, and the uncle of 95-tan. He speaks in the manner of an old man and is respected for his
                        wisdom and experience. After the OS Wars, he retired and occasionally tests his skills with
                        other OS-kuns like 2K-kun and XP-kun.</p>
                    <p>Despite being retired and having a serious demeanor some artworks show him wearing a disco attire
                        and having an afro, suggesting a more casual side to his character.

                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Based upon various artworks and posts from Futaba, he wears a Meiji-era military uniform in
                        either purple (to match his sister, Oobaba) or green. His attire includes a "3.1" medal, and he
                        carries himself with the air of a seasoned veteran.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>While he is seen with a green attire other artworks depict him in a purple outfit. This may
                            have been done to align him with 3.1-tan more but it depends on the artist's choice.</li>
                        <li>Rarely appears in modern OS-tan depictions.</li>
