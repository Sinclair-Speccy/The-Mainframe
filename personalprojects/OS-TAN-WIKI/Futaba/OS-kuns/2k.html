                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>2K-kun represents Windows 2000. He has a calm, rational, and professional demeanor. Highly
                        skilled in both combat and office work, he tends to look after his brothers and sisters with a
                        fatherly nature. He enjoys spending time with his family despite his busy schedule at the office
                        and is often seen with Me-kun and XP-kun, acting as a guardian to the former and a mentor to the
                        latter.</p>
                </section>

                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>2K-kun is portrayed as a man in his late 20s to early 30s with blue eyes and short blue hair.
                        Like 2K-tan, he wears glasses and has a cat ear-like headgear, albeit smaller. He typically
                        wears a blue-grey formal suit with a Windows logo colored tie and a dark blue cape.</p>
                    <p>According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book, anthropomorphised OS characters are not
                        exclusively female. In February 2004, a male version of the anthropomorphized OS characters was
                        introduced. Initially, it was treated as a female type of the same, but as the character became
                        established, it was recognized as a brother and referred to as "OS son".</p>
                    <p>In addition to being called "OSたん", "OSタン", etc., it also started to be called "OS daughter" to
                        pair with the sons. By eventually gaining siblings. The anthropomorphised OS characters acquired
                        more human-like qualities and variations in their daily lives. This allowed them to break away
                        from the trend that had been biased towards the "weak two-sided" aspect centered on female
                        characters.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the existence of the son has played a role in gaining female supporters for the
                        anthropomorphized OS characters, such as original developments unique to the Futaba Yaoi board.
