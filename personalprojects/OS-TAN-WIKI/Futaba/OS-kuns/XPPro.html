            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
              XP-kun is a tall, muscular young man with a kind and cheerful
              demeanor. Despite his brash and sometimes impulsive nature, he is
              gentle and respectful, especially towards animals and children. He
              often spends time with 2K-kun and Me-kun, who watch over his
              training. He also looks out for his younger brother Homeo, sharing
              a mutual understanding about dealing with their sisters.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book,
              anthropomorphized OS characters are not exclusively female. In
              February 2004, male versions of the anthropomorphized OS
              characters was introduced. Initially, it was treated as a female
              type of the same, but as the character became established, it was
              recognized as a brother and referred to as "OS son".
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to being called "OSたん", "OSタン", etc., it also
              started to be called "OS daughter" to pair with the sons. By
              eventually gaining siblings. The anthropomorphised OS characters
              acquired more human-like qualities and variations in their daily
              lives. This allowed them to break away from the trend that had
              been biased towards the "weak two-sided" aspect centered on female
              characters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, the existence of the son has played a role in gaining
              female supporters for the anthropomorphized OS characters, such as
              original developments unique to the Futaba Yaoi board.
