            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
              Windows 98SE-kun is the OS-kun personifying Windows 98 SE, and the
              younger brother of 95-tan, 95-kun, 98-tan, and 98-kun, and the
              elder brother of Me-tan and Me-kun. Known for his alter-ego Masked
              Vulcan SE, he actively participated in the OS Wars and was
              presumed dead after going missing in action. After the wars, it
              was discovered that he was alive and running a coffee shop near
              the Windows family home.

            <p>
              98SE-kun is depicted as a young man in his mid-20s with long
              ice-blue hair and light blue eyes. He often wears turtlenecks and
              basic pants, sometimes tying his hair into a ponytail. He has a
              more feminine appearance and demeanor compared to his brother
              98-kun and often wears "SE" earrings. In his Masked Vulcan SE
              alter-ego, he dons navy blue armor with reversed colors from his
              sisters' outfits.
