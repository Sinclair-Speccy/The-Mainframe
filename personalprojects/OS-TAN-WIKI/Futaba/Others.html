                    <p>This section is for other charactes that may not be major, or have a lack of information to have their own page. It also tries to lists information information about lesser known characters or multiple versions of a character such as Vista.</p>
                    <p>Unlike the main pages, these ones don't have an infobox so the information is put into the main block of text, and the main artwork is put as a link.</p>

    <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">MS-DOS-tan</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>MS-DOS-tan is presented as a shy girl with ponytails. She is a very minor character, even mentioned as such on her creator's site. Art depicting her is very rare. One of the few fan artworks of her shows her interacting with DOS/V. She carries around a keyboard and is usually peeking around corners.</p>

        <p>She first appeared around 2003.</p>
        
        <p>Appearance:</p>
        <p>MS-DOS-tan has hair in pigtails decorated with "DOS"-shaped hair ties; her hair ties are usually blue but are sometimes depicted in the colors of the MS-DOS prompt logo as shown in Windows. She wears round glasses, a white button-down blouse with a light blue skirt, and suspenders.</p>

        <p>Associations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interacts with DOS/V in some artworks that exist.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Notes and Trivia:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information about MS-DOS-tan is limited, and most of it is based on scarce and rare artworks.</li>
            <li>Like Trend Micro Buster-kun (also known as Virus Buster-kun), she is one of the few characters from Futaba who are rarely drawn compared to Norton and XP Pro-tan, despite being made by the same creator.</li>
            <li>Her debut date is based upon the 1st archive of the OS-tan vault hosted at <a href="http://nijiura-os.hp.infoseek.co.jp/">http://nijiura-os.hp.infoseek.co.jp/</a></li>

    <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Dr. Norton is a program-kun personifying Norton Antivirus, known from the Futaba Channel. He often appears alongside Me-tan, 2K-tan, and XP-tan.</p>
        
        <p>Appearance:</p>
        <p>Dr. Norton is depicted as an old male doctor with a white lab coat, a yellow tie, glasses, a stethoscope, and the old Symantec logo on his forehead. He has an ectoplasmic tail instead of legs, referencing Norton Ghost.</p>
        <p>According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan Fan Book on August 24, 2003, the first male character, "Dr. Norton," was introduced. This expanded the "OS Humanization" concept, which had previously included only female characters, so that was his first appearence.</p>
        
        <p>Notes and Trivia:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dr. Norton is characterized as an eccentric and lecherous old doctor.</li>
            <li>In "Troubled Windows," he frequently requests check-ups from the OS-tans, driven by curiosity and perversion.</li>
            <li>He is known to exhibit inappropriate behavior and interests towards the OS-tans.</li>

    <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">Windows 97-tan</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Windows 97-tan, sometimes known as Nana-chan, represents Windows 97, an unreleased version of Windows.</p>
        <p>According to older Futaba Channel threads, a character getting a storage facility is proof of popularity, and she has one of her own.</p>
        <p>She has even been suggested as the character for Windows 7 in certain translations:</p>
        
        <p>English:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Hmmm. I'm sorry to say that now the rivalry is boiling over.</p>
            <p>But they are already crazy about Nana-chan!</p>
            <p>It's the same as if they decided on Nana as the personified character of Windows 7! Great victory!</p>
            <p>Kya~! Nana-chan is too cute, getting drunk on her own without knowing that she's been under the sun for three days!”</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Japanese:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>「ふふん。今更になって対抗馬どもが沸いてきてるアル でも、もう「」たちはナナちゃんにﾒﾛﾒﾛ！ Windows７の擬人化ｷｬﾗはナナちゃんで決まったも同じアルネ！大勝利！！」</p>
            <p>「きゃ～っ！三日天下とも知らず図に乗って酔いしれてるナナちゃん可愛過ぎ！」</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Nana-chan's design features brown hair styled in buns with braids and tassels, and a red traditional Chinese-style dress shirt with a Windows logo brooch on the collar. Underneath, she wears a school swimsuit paired with shorts. The Kanji for '97' is displayed on her forehead.</p>

        <p>She is considered the "most minor thing in OS anthropomorphism," but despite being a minor character, she seems to have had a dedicated fanbase.</p>
        <p>There seems to be a gag of her covering up the kanji on her forehead except for the 7, determined to pass herself off as Windows 7-tan.</p>
        
        <p>Her first appearance is unknown.</p>

        <p>Odyssey-tan is one of the rarer characters from Futaba and is hardly ever drawn.</p>
        <p>It can be presumed that characters like Windows 97, the two Longhorn designs, Moseko, and Neptune are her friends because artworks show her with them more than once.</p>

        <p>Odyssey-tan wears a light blue dress with puffy sleeves, black and white accents, and a white ascot. She also has a pair of floating gold wings and, depending on the artist, a gold halo above her head.</p>

    <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Neptune-tan is an OS-tan that represents Windows Neptune, one of the cancelled Windows versions.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes, she is shown with large weapons and is often depicted with characters like Windows 97, Odyssey, Moseko, and two of the Longhorn designs, suggesting they are her friends.</p>
        
        <p>There have been some artworks where she appears without her visor.</p>

        <p>Appearance:</p>
        <p>Neptune-tan wears a black sleeveless qipao with blue accents and large red bracelets. She has a red talisman around her collar and mechanical headpieces. She also has long green hair in pigtails and is almost always seen wearing a red visor.</p>

            <li>Drawn by one artist at Futaba named "イオンのバイド" on Pixiv or "Ion no Baido", though it can be assumed they did not make her concept because the art styles for the sketch for Neptune's first design and their art are very different.</li>

    <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">Windows Longhorn-tan(s)</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>There are various Longhorn designs, and these seem to be the ones mostly drawn. No wiki really documents information about them either, so this is based on personal research.</p>
        <p>It can be presumed that characters like Windows 97, Odyssey, Moseko, and Neptune are their friends because artworks show her with them more than once.</p>
        <p>The shorter-looking Longhorn is said to be the taller one's sister.</p>
        <p>Outside of these designs, there have been other concepts for Longhorn designs such as <a href="https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/v3/download/matrix.org/PyfMDOwYUStIHspnNckvFjCL?allow_redirect=true">this one</a> seen in a comic called <a href="https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/v3/download/matrix.org/kbvMAmFgJWnnKBllACFSmfPS?allow_redirect=true">OS Zodiac</a>, <a href="https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/v3/download/matrix.org/lfXuvGGpDorSjGWjXMrEuhxZ?allow_redirect=true">this one with wings and pointy elf ears</a>, <a href="https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/v3/download/matrix.org/FnLcgqVxaoChfJyQxdGFQDAd?allow_redirect=true">this one with more spiral-like horns</a>, <a href="https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/v3/download/matrix.org/nGzgZhMfupEiRHAvWVmaRsZk?allow_redirect=true">this one</a> which can be found in a <a href="https://www.ostan-collections.net/gallery/picture.php?/34907/search/psk-20240731-Wj4lKyfFQR">wallpaper</a> with a slightly altered design, <a href="https://www.ostan-collections.net/gallery/picture.php?/38723/search/psk-20240731-Wj4lKyfFQR">this one</a> which is seen in an <a href="https://www.ostan-collections.net/gallery/picture.php?/34428/category/9">artwork</a> with characters like the older XP-tan design and <a href="https://www.ostan-collections.net/gallery/picture.php?/38726/category/996">this one</a>.</p>

        <p>Appearance:</p>
        <p>The pink-haired Longhorn design features a sleeveless, form-fitting crop top in a light blue or teal color with white accents around the edges. The top is cut high to reveal her midriff, matching light blue or teal mini-skirt with white accents. The skirt is also tight and short, paired with shoes that match the color scheme of the outfit, featuring blue or teal and white tones, and two large, black, pointed horns protruding from her head.</p>
        <p>The younger-looking yellow-haired Longhorn has a pink sleeveless dress with a darker pink colored tie with the Windows logo in a diamond shape. She is also wearing black thigh-high stockings and light pink boots with pink accents that match the dress, mechanical-looking elf ears attached to a headband, and a small horn coming from her forehead.</p>

    <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">Linux-tan</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Linux-tan is the personified character of Linux, a Unix-compatible open-source OS.</p>
        <p>When she first appeared, she overwhelmed other OSes with her incredible abilities, but now she has faded into obscurity and is rarely seen.</p>
        <p>She most likely debuted around the beginning of 2004 as the OS-tan fanbook shows the monster penguin design along with Lindows (Linspire), while the Futaba★Rainbow Board wiki has February 2004.</p>
        
        <p>Appearance:</p>
        <p>She was originally depicted as a young girl with light skin, long hime-cut blueish or purple hair, red or pinkish eyes, a loose, sleeveless blue dress with gold accents, flipper-shaped shoes, a spear with multiple ribbons attached near the spearhead, and a large helmet with a penguin bill-like visor, gnu horns, and a row of gear teeth running down the middle.</p>
        <p>This design often incorporated logos from Linux-related projects, such as the KDE "K" stamped on her helmet, the GNOME footprint logo printed on her dress, and the names of different Linux bootloaders emblazoned on the spear's ribbons.</p>
        <p>Over time, this began to change as this design became a large bearded penguin with horns (a reference to the GNU GPL), a row of gear-teeth running down the top of his head (most likely alluding to the gear-based KDE logo), and a spear. Sadly, this design is nsfw depending on the artist.</p>
        
        <p>Associations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sometimes shown alongside Lindows/Linspire-tan.</li>

        <p>Notes and Trivia:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux-tan was originally depicted as a young girl but later evolved into a bearded penguin with horns.</li>
            <li>Her design often incorporated logos from Linux-related projects and names of different Linux bootloaders.</li>
            <li>Over time, her popularity has faded, and she is rarely seen now.</li>

    <h2 class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown(this)">Lindows-tan</h2>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Lindows-tan, also known as Linspire-tan, is the personification of Lindows, a Linux distribution also known as Linspire.</p>
        <p>Not much is known about her character as most Japanese wikis have not really documented her and have to rely on artworks with her.</p>
        
        <p>Appearance:</p>
        <p>Lindows-tan is depicted as a girl with blue and green hair wearing a white outfit. Her original design features long, flowing hair, a large white shirt with the Linspire logo, white tights, and blue shoes.</p>
        <p>Another version, more representative of Linspire, shows her with twin buns decorated with the CNR icon, hook-shaped pigtails, and a Chinese dress with gold trim and the Linspire logo. This pigtailed version is considered her current self, while the long-haired design represents her past self from when Linspire was known as Lindows. However, the original design is sometimes also used to represent Linspire-tan.</p>
        <p>According to the Trouble Windows OS-tan fanbook, she made her debut around the beginning of 2004 but was seen with the Linux monster character and not the Linux-tan design.</p>
        
        <p>Associations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interacts with Inu-T or Me-tan in some art.</li>
            <li>Often shown along with Linux-tan and less of the Linux penguin monster.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Notes and Trivia:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Represents both Lindows and Linspire.</li>
            <li>One Futaba post refers to her as "りんすぱいあ殿" or "Rinspia-dono".</li>

        <p>Pictures of McAfee are not very common. In contrast to other antivirus software, the McAfee-tan is portrayed as a blonde woman dressed in a long red dress. Occasionally, she can be seen with a red-yellow colored monocle or wearing European clothing.</p>

        <p>Information is lacking about her, but based on existing artworks, she may be portrayed as more refined compared to Norton and Virus Buster.
