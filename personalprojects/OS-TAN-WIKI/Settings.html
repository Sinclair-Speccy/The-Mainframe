                    <h2>Settings and Lores</h2>
<p>Okay okay... depending on who you ask they may say there <em>is</em> a setting and lore for OS-tans, and <em>no</em> for OS-tans having a setting and lore.</p>

    <p>If it is said that "The variations vary from person to person, and it can be said that there are as many different OStan worlds as there are painters." on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040605110411/http://shinjuku.cool.ne.jp:80/heika_love/">Heika Love page</a>, then this should really mean that each person's lore and setting for OS-tans is different, therefore no real "canon" anyway. But consistent details? To be fair I wouldn't call that canon either but rather the consistent details are what most people use which are things like the characters being sisters to one another.</p>

    <p>Even on one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041125070947fw_/http://www.futaba-ostan.net/FAQ/faq.htm">image vaults for OS-tans has a FAQ</a> stating that "There is no official setting. The designs and personalities vary depending on the person who draws them." though it is affiliated with 2channel (neither was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040804160038fw_/http://nijiura-os.hp.infoseek.co.jp/tttt.html">OG image vault anyway</a>) so I think it shouldn't matter.</p>

    <p>There was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071115075423/http://www.geocities.jp/toshiaki_2004jp/">site</a> which was said to be a site that supports and explains "OS Musume" from Futaba â˜† Channel / 2D Ura@Futaba but it appears to have not been updated very much.</p>
