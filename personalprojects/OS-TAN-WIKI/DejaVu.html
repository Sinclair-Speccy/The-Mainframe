                    <h1>Analysis of the Deja Vu Artworks and OS-tan Controversy</h1>
        
        <p>Many people may recognize "Deja Vu" or "Deja Vu Artworks" as the doujin group known for creating OS-tan comics. However, they are also infamous for allegedly attempting to claim OS-tans as their own. Much of this controversy as seen in the western side seems to stem from an older version of the OS-tan Wikipedia article, which lacked reliable sources to support these claims. This made me want to look deeper into the drama as an outsider and piece it together. The result is this summary, which represents my analysis of the situation.</p>

        <p>By the way if you're gonna use this for like a youtube video, please link back to it or at least give me credit... there is most likely mistakes here and there as well so welp.</p>

        <h2>The Actual Drama</h2>
        
        <p>At some point, Deja Vu Artworks began publishing Shared Folder DA! (共有フォルDA!), a manga featuring OS-tan characters. While it gained recognition, the group faced criticism for misrepresenting the OS-tans’ personalities. The original OS-tans were known for their depth and satirical charm but in Shared Folder DA!, they were reimagined as generic "moe" characters, losing much of the humour and community-driven uniqueness. Deja Vu failed to properly credit Futaba as the origin of OS-tans. This omission along with promotional language that implied the characters were original to Shared Folder DA!, led to confusion. Some even believed that Deja Vu had created the OS-tans, which enraged the Futaba community, known collectively as "Toshiaki." There are some more issues that Deja Vu did besides the "cosplay" incident and trying to claim ownership.</p>

        <h2>Specific Issues with Deja Vu</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Reluctance to Credit Futaba</strong><br>
            Deja Vu delayed acknowledging Futaba as the origin of OS-tans despite repeated community requests. When they finally added a credit, it was vague and poorly timed, appearing during Comiket, where the audience was unlikely to notice it. Deja Vu also published a manga featuring 2K-tan, marked with "© Deja Vu," adding to the accusations of ownership claims. Deja Vu later described this as a careless mistake, but the damage was done.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Diary Provocations</strong><br>
            On June 7–8, 2004, Deja Vu members published diary entries mocking the Futaba community. While Deja Vu claimed their remarks targeted disruptive individuals, many Toshiaki interpreted them as insults to the broader community. Deja Vu’s attempt to frame the posts as addressing only "stalkers" further alienated Futaba users, who felt the remarks were unjustified and inflammatory. The diary entries included lines such as "としあきはもっとセンスあふれるレスをつけるもんだ" (Toshiaki usually posts with more wit), and comments dismissing detractors as "キモいデブヲタ" (gross fat otaku).</li>
            
            <li><strong>Unauthorized Publication of Cosplay Photos</strong><br>
            A Futaba user known as "Fukushoku Aki" designed an XP cosplay outfit and allowed MALINO, a member of Deja Vu, to try it on under the condition that the photos remain private. However, Deja Vu published the photos on their site. The situation worsened when a hidden link on Deja Vu’s website (text matching the background colour) was discovered, further fuelling accusations that Deja Vu had violated the agreement. Deja Vu claimed they acted to counter misinformation but later deleted the link following complaints from Fukushoku Aki.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Closure of Discussion Boards</strong><br>
            Deja Vu operated discussion boards for feedback and questions. By September 2004, these boards were closed without addressing many unresolved issues, leading to more community frustration. Deja Vu continued posting on their feedback board while avoiding engagement on critical topics, worsening the divide with Toshiaki.</li>
            
            <li><strong>NT-tan</strong><br>
            Deja Vu created their own NT design as part of their works with claims that Futaba saw her as a bootleg design, though I never saw any claims about her being seen as a bootleg design when researching. All I found was this: It was speculated that this is attempting to present Shared Folder DA! as an original creation of OS Girls but in reality she was simply based on 2K, and they wanted to add the NT-like personality with a similar appearance and character, plus the sharp tongue. Whenever she was a “bootleg” or not is up to the reader as I can’t say for certain.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Related Drama with NetRunner Magazine</h2>
        
        <p>This was not the first controversy involving OS-tans and attribution issues. NetRunner, a prominent Japanese magazine, published a Me-tan trading card without proper attribution to Futaba, instead crediting 2ch as the source. Deja Vu’s involvement with NetRunner added another layer to the drama. After being confronted about connections to the magazine, Deja Vu denied working with them and retroactively altered their work history section to reflect this. For example, they updated their website to claim that they did work with NetRunner but involved "事後承諾で転載されただけだし" (unauthorized reprinting without proper agreement). This lack of transparency further tarnished their reputation.</p>
