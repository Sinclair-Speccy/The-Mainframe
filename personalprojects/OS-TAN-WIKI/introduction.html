    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        OS-tans are moe personification representations of computer operating systems, often depicted as anime-style characters. These characters first emerged from Japanese online communities in the early 2000s, originating on the Nijiura board of Futaba Channel, a board with "no rules."

    <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        OS-tans originated from Japanese online communities in the early 2000s, first from Futaba Channel, then +Nijiura+. On Futaba Channel specifically, it was the Nijiura board where OS-tans came from—a board with "no rules." 
    </p>
    <p>
        The suffix "-tan" is a Japanese honorific that is a childlike or affectionate mispronunciation of "-chan," which is itself a diminutive and endearing suffix often used for close friends, young children, or cute characters. Although widely known as “OS-tan" in the western fandom, the term “XX-tan” has tended to be avoided at Futaba, and this term has been abandoned in favor of “OS Musume” or "OS Girl" (the male version is “OS Son”). This shift in terminology is said to be due to a change in attitude towards the characters—from caring for them to loving them—but also related to drama involving Déjà Vu Artworks and Netrunner.

    <h2>Character Design and Creation</h2>
    <p>
        Each OS-tan character is designed to reflect the features, strengths, and even the bugs or flaws of the operating system they represent. For example, an OS-tan for an older or less stable OS might be depicted as clumsy or fragile, while a more stable OS-tan could be portrayed as confident and reliable. Some artists also use in-jokes or personal preferences for their characters, such as Vistake and CE-tan.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for who made them, characters like Me-tan and XP-tan have their respective creators, who are Me-aki and XP Kaki-Aki. However, in the early days, it can be said that everyone at Futaba contributed to making them, as they gave the artists ideas and suggestions.

    <h2>Official Use and Cultural Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Although OS-tans started as fan-made characters, some have been used in official advertising campaigns by companies like Microsoft in Asian countries, such as Inori and Nanami Madobe.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's important to note that not every personification is considered an OS-tan, and the term's use is subjective, depending on individual interpretation. Additionally, the culture surrounding OS-tans, especially on the Nijiura board, can include content that is not suitable for all audiences. The Nijiura board operates with a "no rules" mentality, which means you might encounter NSFW material without warning.
