          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            OS-tans are moe personification representations of computer
            operating systems, often depicted as anime-style characters. These
            characters first emerged from Japanese online communities in the
            early 2000s, originating on the Nijiura board of Futaba Channel, a
            board with "no rules."
          </p>
          <p>
            When you think of OS-tans, the first thing that likely comes to mind
            is the “main cast” such as XP-tan, 95-tan, Me-tan, 2K-tan, and so
            on. These characters are often considered the “canon” characters
            within the OS-tan community. For the average fan, these characters
            might just be admired for their designs or personalities. However,
            various OS-tan communities have shown flaws and issues in how
            information is presented, how research is conducted, and how the
            characters are interpreted. To address these issues which are part
            of the history itself, it's essential to start from the beginning:
            how OS-tans even came to be.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
          <p>
            OS-tans originated from Japanese online communities in the early
            2000s, particularly from Futaba Channel's Nijiura board, known for
            its chaotic and collaborative nature. The suffix "-tan" is a
            Japanese honorific that is a childlike or affectionate
            mispronunciation of "-chan," which is itself a diminutive and
            endearing suffix often used for close friends, young children, or
            cute characters. Although widely known as “OS-tan" in the western
            fandom, the term “XX-tan” has tended to be avoided at Futaba, where
            the preferred terms are “OS Musume” or "OS Girl" with the male
            version being “OS Son”. This shift in terminology is said to be due
            to a change in attitude towards the characters—from caring for them
            to loving them—but also drama involving Déjà Vu Artworks and
            Netrunner who either tried to claim ownership of them, or something
            else.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concept of moe personification isn’t entirely new, but it was
            Futaba Channel that popularised the trend. The Nijiura board, while
            notorious for its NSFW content, is also known for its unspoken rules
            regarding image use. Members understand that images posted can be
            freely used as references, modified, or incorporated into stories.
            This collaborative effort, where images are often edited and
            transformed into new creations, played a crucial role in the birth
            and evolution of OS-tans.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, Me-tan, the first OS-tan, was created on August 6,
            2003, when someone commented on a Windows Me System Properties
            image, saying, "But Windows Me is cute even though it's no good."
            This comment led to the personification of Windows Me, marking the
            beginning of the OS-tan phenomenon. The community quickly embraced
            this idea, and soon, various versions of other OS-tans like 2K-tan,
            XP-tan, and 95-tan were created by different artists, or "Toshiaki,"
            as they are sometimes called. These artists and craftsmen, though
            anonymous, played a significant role in shaping the OS-tan
            characters through their collaborative and chaotic creative process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Nijiura community operates on a system where images are posted,
            responded to, and further developed through collaboration, with
            community members contributing by adding stories, attributes, and
            designs to the characters through their responses. This
            collaborative process involves artists drawing based on community
            input, craftsmen creating collages, and further iterations that
            refine the characters. Over time, these contributions lead to the
            creation of major versions of OS-tans while preserving minor
            variations in memory, making the growth of OS-tans a truly
            collective effort involving many Toshiaki.

        <section>
          <h2>Character Design and Creation</h2>
          <p>
            Each OS-tan character is designed to reflect the features,
            strengths, and even the bugs or flaws of the operating system they
            represent. For example, an OS-tan for an older or less stable OS
            might be depicted as clumsy or fragile, while a more stable OS-tan
            could be portrayed as confident and reliable. Some artists also use
            in-jokes or personal preferences for their characters, such as
            Vistake and CE-tan.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for who made them, characters like Me-tan and XP-tan have their
            respective creators, who are Me-aki and XP Kaki-Aki. However, in the
            early days, it can be said that everyone at Futaba's Nijiura board
            contributed to making them, as they gave the artists ideas and
            suggestions. Therefore, it is not just a specific painter who
            created these characters, but rather an unspecified group of people
            who collectively nurtured them. The community of Nijiura was deeply
            involved in the development of OS-tans, with residents contributing
            ideas and inspiration to painters and craftsmen.

          <h2>Spread outside of Futaba & the English-speaking community</h2>
          <p>
            OS-tan Collections is no doubt the biggest OS-tan place to exist (if
            you exclude Nijiura as they have never had a formal official wiki).
            If you were to go ask an OS-tan fan if they knew what OS-tan
            Collections is, they might say they know of it. Assuming that OSC’s
            own wiki is correct OS-tan Collections was founded in early March
            2005 by FabianN because of his interest in OS-tans. OS-tan
            Collections grew slowly from then on, remaining a low-profile forum,
            small compared to Nijura or Wakachan. FabianN would leave in late
            2005, leaving the forum to the care of Pitkin and Fedora. It was
            stagnant during the summer of 2006, receiving less than a post per
            day and was considered for closing. In the late summer, the arrival
            of a flock of new members and the addition of the website of Google
            and Wikipedia would breathe new life into the forum. The expansion
            of the gallery during late 2006 would make the forum a gateway for
            people interested in OS-tans. The addition of the Wiki and Download
            Section in early 2007 started a new era for the forum.
          </p>
          <p>
            OS-tan Collections dominated the early 2000s and onwards in the west
            that if you use sites to see backlinks and put OS-tan Collection’s
            URL in, you may just see how big of a dominance it had and still
            has….

          <p>
            A fandom wiki for tropes has an image of MS-DOS-tan that links back
            to OSC (<a href="https://tropedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shrinking_Violet"
              >source</a

              >source</a
            >), the Wikipedia articles for the Worldwide Military Command and
            Control System links back to WWMCCS-tan’s entry (no joke, look at
            ref 8 on the page for the WWMCCS
            <a

              >source</a
            >), the Linux Mint forums talk about how Linux Mint doesn’t have a
            mascot and link back to Touko’s page at OSC (<a
              href="https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=255220"
              >source</a
            >), the Inkscape wiki used to use C-Chan’s gallery at OSC to show
            anime-style artwork produced almost entirely in Inkscape (<a
              href="https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php?title=Galleries&oldid=91358"
              >source</a
            >), the list goes on and on that even the site for MSX-DOS-tan links
            back to which is in Japanese (<a
              href="https://coffeekan.usamimi.info/room/msxdos/index.html"
              >source</a
            >). You can use a site like seomator.com to see more but OSC is
            essentially “everywhere” in a way.

            OS-tan Collections was also responsible for making more OS-tans such
            as Amiga-tan, more Mac-tans as Futaba only had one for Mac OS X and
            Mac OS 9 and so on. Go forward to September 16, 2006, in the “OS-tan
            Fan-Fics, Comics and Fan-Stuff” on the forums there was a post
            started by C-Chan called “OS-tan Annex Project”. Below are the
            contents of the main quote of the post:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Hello and welcome everyone to the OS-tan Annex thread. ^__^</p>
            <p>
              Here I've chosen to consolidate all the OS-tan renditions, fanart
              and contributions that make up the building blocks of the annex to
              the OS-tan universe that I'm developing. This "Annex" is meant to
              be a backstory intended to integrate my new OS-tans into the
              preexisting OS-tan universe without overwriting too much work done
              by countless other artists. For this reason I've categorized the
              OS-tans into "factions", not to force political separations on the
              poor girls, but rather to better organize the storytelling
              elements. It would certainly be much easier to remember an obscure
              OS-tan if she has a familiar group representing her. ^__^
            </p>
            <p>
              The first 17 posts on this thread are where I will be posting my
              content or any valuable content created by others. So whenever I
              churn out new drawings, or artists create new OS-tans, or
              biographies need updating or new OS-tans are suggested, look to
              these pages for the updated material. I'll likely flag it somehow
              for easy identification.
            </p>
            <p>
              All other posts after that are free-for-all, of course. My goal is
              to get away from posting a thread for each new OS-tan, in order to
              free up space, ensure that their background info is easily
              accessible, and (hopefully) streamline the conversation pertaining
              to new OS-tans or the Annex in general. If this format works, the
              subsequent posts should make for some very interesting reading.
              ^__^
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep in mind that, due to time constraints, these posts are still
              under construction as of this writing. New OS-tans will only be
              displayed with their chibi preconcepts (and not with Wiki-style
              logos as I had hoped I'd have done by now), and it's likely that
              not every preexisting OS-tan will have her link(s) set up yet. In
              short, as is always the case with me, this will all look like one
              giant mess. ^^'
            </p>
            <p>
              But please bear with me for a while, and I promise this thread
              will flourish with sweet (56K-friendly) eye-candy one day. ^v^
            </p>

            OS-tan Collection’s Annex Project is what conveyed OS-tan
            Collections as a whole. In short, The Annex Project is by no means
            official but is an expanded universe that strives to integrate the
            new OS-tan characters and backstories with those of other OS-tan
            artists while still staying faithful to the original OS-tan "canon"
            and the work of other artists. Of course, this came with its own
            faults when the wiki was established in 2007.
