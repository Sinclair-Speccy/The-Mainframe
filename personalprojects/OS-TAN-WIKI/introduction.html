          <h2>What are OS-tans?</h2>
          <p>
            OS-tans are anthropomorphised representations of computer operating systems, often depicted as anime-style characters. These characters are usually female and designed to embody the traits, features, and even quirks or flaws of the operating system they represent. For example, an OS-tan representing a more stable and reliable OS might be depicted as a confident and competent character, while an OS-tan for a less stable system might appear clumsy or fragile.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same logic applies to the male versions of these characters, known as OS-kuns.

          <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
          <p>
            OS-tans originated from Japanese online communities in the early 2000s. They first appeared on the Futaba Channel, particularly on the Nijiura board, which is known for its lack of strict rules and creative freedom. Nijiura served as a home for user-generated content, allowing anonymous users to create and share their versions of OS-tans, leading to a diverse range of characters. The OS-tan phenomenon later spread to other online communities and gained popularity elsewhere, though with some variations and adaptations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other characters like Chiivistan and the Mac OS X cat girls come from +Nijiura+, a separate image-board, its name not related to the Nijiura board at Futaba Channel.
          </p>
            <p>The suffix "-tan" is a Japanese honorific that is a childlike or affectionate mispronunciation of "-chan," which is itself a diminutive and endearing suffix often used for close friends, young children, or cute characters. The use of "-tan" in "OS-tan" reflects a playful tone. However, in the original Japanese context, particularly within the Futaba Channel community, the term "OS Musume" (literally "OS Girl") or "OS-son" (for male characters) has become more of the used term within Futaba Channel.</p>
            <p>Why the change? You could chalk it up to the drama related to Deja Vu who tried to claim them as their own but also the fact this shift in terminology reflects a change in how the characters are perceived, moving from being simply cared for to being beloved by the residents of Nijura.</p>
            <p>It's also worth noting that the term "OS-tan" is not universally defined but is more commonly used for operating systems in general. Different communities may interpret it differently, people may use it for a catch-all term for technology related gijinkas in general and some creators or fans may choose to distance their work from the "OS-tan" label while making their own OS gijinkas. Therefore, while "OS-tan" is widely recognised, its meaning can vary depending on context and personal interpretation.</p>

          <h2>Character Design and Creation</h2>
          <p>
            OS-tan characters are typically designed to reflect the specific features, strengths, and weaknesses of the operating system they represent. For instance, an OS-tan for Windows XP might be portrayed as energetic and reliable, reflecting the operating system's popularity and stability, while an OS-tan for Windows ME (Millennium Edition) might be depicted as clumsy or prone to errors, mirroring the OS's reputation for instability.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design of each OS-tan often incorporates visual elements that reference the OS's user interface, logo, or other distinguishing features. For example, an OS-tan might wear clothing in the color scheme of the OS's interface, or carry accessories that symbolize the OS's functions or issues. However this is not always the case as characters such as Homeko were based on jokes from Futaba Channel.
          </p>
            <p>As for who created them, it's a collaborative effort. Characters like Me-tan (Windows ME) and XP-tan (Windows XP) have specific creators, known as Me-aki and XP Kaki-Aki. In the early days of the OS-tan phenomenon the creation process was cooperative. Users on Futaba Channel would suggest ideas, give feedback, and contribute to the development of the characters. Many characters evolved through the input of multiple anonymous contributors.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Spread outside of Futaba</h2>
          <p>
            While OS-tans originated as fan-made characters, they have occasionally been used in official capacities. For example, Microsoft has utilized OS-tan-like characters in some of their marketing campaigns in Asian countries. Notable examples include Inori Aizawa, who was used as a mascot for Internet Explorer in Singapore, and Nanami Madobe, who was created to promote Windows 7 in Japan.

          <h2>More about OS-tans</h2>
          <p>
            To learn more about OS-tans, you can explore various online resources, including dedicated websites, forums, and wikis. However, it's important to note that the OS-tan community and its content can be diverse and sometimes contain mature themes. The Nijiura board, where OS-tans first gained popularity, is known for its anything-goes approach, which can include both wholesome and not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content.
          </p>
            <p>Additionally, some creators within the community specialize in lolicon art offsite away from Futaba Channel, which can be controversial. As such, it's advisable to approach these resources with an understanding of the varying content and the different cultural norms that may influence it.</p>
