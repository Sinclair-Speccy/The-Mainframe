                    <h2>Update 1 - Another OS-tan thing?</h2>
                    <p>Yeah... another OS-tan thing. The idea hit me after I was working on the subreddit wiki and
                        realised what I was writing started to become complex for something concise as I found more
                        resources to use.</p>
                    <p>This means I need to be extremely blunt:</p>
                    <p>This wiki is a <strong>PERSONAL PROJECT</strong> which uses <strong>ALREADY EXISTING</strong>
                        sources of information plus my <strong>OWN RESEARCH</strong>.</p>
                    <p>I know what I said may be rude or harsh, but I am stating this before anyone asks "why is there
                        another wiki when we have two already". It is something I am doing for fun but also the fact
                        there are OS-tans from both Futaba and +Nijiura+ who only have "fanfiction" written up about
                        them when there is no "canon" info about them. Not every character is bound to have reliable
                        information of them and we have to go by art alone.</p>
                    <p>Now that I have said this, I suggest reading the introduction and FAQ if you have not already.
                    </p>
                    <p>Not all pages are complete, in fact you could say none are fully complete. What you see so far is
                        basic info for now as I plan on digging into researching the art by artists later. I just wanted
                        to get this section out of the way... so please remember that <strong>all pages</strong> are
                        still logically a WIP.</p>
