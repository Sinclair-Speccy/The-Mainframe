                    <h2>Update 2 - New updates</h2>
                      <h1>A new day and a new update, heh.</h1>
    <p>Got sidetracked over the past few weeks as I went down a OS-tan research rabbit hole and tried to fix the HTML code formatting for the pages. The cleaned up HTML code may not interest you but the rabbit hole might...</p>
    <p>The first thing is that the settings section on the menu bar is actually a page now, though it actually only explains that it is said that there is no real setting. The more important part though is that I was doing more research and if you go to pixiv, you will notice that the more common tag to find OS-tan content is actually <strong>OS娘 (OS musume)</strong> and not <strong>OSたん (OS-tan)</strong>. A few places that are from Japan like the Futaba★Backstage wiki, Pixiv and Futaba★Rainbow Board wiki all note that "OS-tan" is the former name used for these characters.</p>
    <p>Why the name change? From what I can gather it is either because of the unauthorised use of OS anthropomorphic characters outside of Futaba, or as the affection for anthropomorphic OSes deepened, more and more people rejected the term “XX-tan,” which has a strong nuance of “pet” or “common moe character,” and as a result, “OS-tan" was abolished and replaced with “OS musume”. It was also done to match the OS-kun which are more known as "OS son" similar to how OS musume is literally OS girl.</p>
    <p>I have decided to edit the entries to include OS Musume and so to try and make it accurate because if you're going to aim to be accurate it makes more sense to use OS musume, no? It has been said that since the drama has died off with the unauthorised use it may not matter but lets just include all the terms anyway? Some entries may not have these new things however as characters like Homeko, Homeo, Saba and such are usually named by their human names.</p>
    <p>The funny part about this is that this means every other wiki about OS-tans outside of Futaba is using the old term lol. Some pages will still use OS-tan however unless I change it in the meantime...</p>
    <p>Along with the new research, I found new info and sources so expect a Linux-tan page later in the week.</p>
