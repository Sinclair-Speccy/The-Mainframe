                        <p>The information on this wiki is primarily based on the research conducted by me, as well as
                            other wikis and places.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="dropdown-content">
                        <p>While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information, it should be
                            acknowledged that it may not be 100% correct. As you translate some of the sources used for
                            research you might notice OS-tans are flexible on Futaba Channel. What I mean by this is the
                            fact while some details are consistent, others are not and are listed as canon at other
                            places, even if not stated that the information is posed as canon.</p>
                        <p>Everyone contributed to making OS-tans at Futaba and everyone's idea of them will vary,
                            removing things they don’t like and adding things they prefer. These headcanons (or
                            different ideas for a character) will end up on other wikis such as the Japanese ones
                            without any actual source, yet some of these other wikis and sites are listed in "other
                            links" on characters for the sake of having them listed anyway.</p>
                        <p>A lot is left to interpretation like other fandoms (Touhou & Vocaloid), older threads from
                            Futaba are gone (as older ones are deleted) so we will never know what was truly intended of
                            their creators and some sources are IP-restricted.</p>
                        <p>All of this is why the information on this wiki is based upon observing artworks, looking at
                            the IP-restricted content with a VPN and the other wikis/sources. People should consider
                            this wiki as a valuable resource as every other source but not an absolute authority. People
                            should also remember that OS-tans vary across person with interpretation and design.</p>

                        OS-tans?</h2>
                    <div class="dropdown-content">
                        <p>"Legacy" is a term that can refer to many OS-tans from the early days. My interest primarily
                            lies in the original OS-tans that emerged during the early fandom period. For me, "Legacy"
                            spans from the early 2000s until the early 2010s.</p>
                        <p>Characters like Futanana, Battenichi, Ten-chan, and 11-chan may fall outside this focus as
                            they represent newer additions to the OS-tan lineup, they do not interest me and this is
                            when the Madobe characters were more popular. Some of these characters might technically be
                            considered part of the Legacy OS-tans. My primary aim is to create a comprehensive resource
                            centered on the legacy Futaba OS-tans. For those looking for information on the newer Futaba
                            characters, other wikis might be more suitable.</p>

                        <p>This wiki does not intend to replace other existing wikis because each wiki has its own
                            unique value and perspective. This wiki is meant to complement other resources by providing
                            additional detail and a different perspective based on personal research.</p>

                        <p>This is something I don’t really like talking about however in all honesty… while I may
                            dislike OSC for its Annex project due to canon and fanon not really being split apart
                            properly, it is an example of how an entirely different community from the other side of the
                            world can take what already exists (Futaba's works) and expand on it in its own ways. It
                            took me until 2024 to come to this conclusion. Of course you have to overlook the glaring
                            issues such as glurge.</p>
                        <p>So yes while I dislike OSC, on the other hand it is an example of the creative side from a
                            different community and is going to be on the site regardless. I guess you can say it is
                            useful in its own ways for what it is an example of.</p>
