      <h1 class="title">The Packard Bell Club 533C</h1>
      <p>Well well well, wasn't this a deal? I saw this PC listed on ebay for like $90. It was a bid so I bidded the $90 and waited to see if I got it and to mu excitement I did get it! Since the listing had postage too it added up to $110 but that isn't too bad compared to the prices I see computers listed here for as they're all so expensive! </p>

      <h2 class="title">History</h2>
      <p>The history? Well, originally I was trying to install Windows 98SE on the old family PC on a seperate hard drive but nothing would work as it only had 1GB of RAM and Window 98 and 98SE hate having 1GB for some reason. After a lot of trial and error I kinda gave up in dismay and well, waited to see if I could find a cheap retro PC. A lot of the PCs I found were too expensive and either the buyer wanted so much more for postage or wouldn't post at all until one day I saw the Club 355C listed on ebay for a cheap price so I launched into it and bidded on it. To my exictement no one else bidded on it and I won the bid! It arriced way earlier than expected too but that was a bonus. </p>

		  <p>This was the box it came in. A bit misleading but I can imagine if someone was a porch pirate and took this PC they were in for a surprise!</p>
		  
     <img src="/Images/Club 533C/5b479d4a84368bb1.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
		  <p>I was worried it would come shattered and in pieces but it seems the person I brought it from took good care to make sure it got here safely. It was even in <i>two layers</i> of bubblewrap!</p>
		  
	  <img src="/Images/Club 533C/0d8c56023ea07aad.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
		  <p>This is the front of the PC. The box it came stated it was 12KG but I swear it feels heavier than that.</p>
		  
      <img src="/Images/Club 533C/805a8a5fb4610ab8.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
		   <img src="Images/Club 533C/e9ccb694cb73a532.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
		  <p>The stickers on it. It has a "Designed for Windows 98" and a Intel Celeron one. The case also has a Year 2000 Compliant one.</p>
		  
      <img src="/Images/Club 533C/21a52eedf8953310.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
	  <p>Startup stuff. It has a ASUS P4SGL-VM as you can tell. Haven't seen the Energy Star logo in a long time.</p>
	  
		  
      <img src="/Images/Club 533C/cad60688a240d055.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
	  <p>Picture duing the setup. Before I got this I tried to install Windows 98 on the ASUS P5GZ-MX but that had far too much RAM so I couldn't install Windows 98SE however on this Packard Bell I can!</p>
		  
		  
      <img src="/Images/Club 533C/66ba4ad069e2744e.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
	  <p>The Windows 98SE desktop itself. This was way before I had to fix display drivers to get the right resolution and get 256 colours working.</p>
		  
		 <img src="/Images/Club 533C/5e3b0a1c0650c8f9.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
	  <p>What I can tell ya is that the 90s loved drivers. I had to get drivers for the IGP and USB so during that process I got a blue screen... I also got the Windows Protection Error so that was not fun.</p>

		  <img src="/Images/Club 533C/44fa527bf0f68759.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
	  <p>Thankfully after all the struggles I finally got stuff to work and I could play a game that was on the XP machine that was made for Windows 98, Carnivores!</p>
		  
		    <img src="/Images/Club 533C/af07b104b88313ef.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
	  <p>These were some pictures I had to take of the inside of the PC when I had to get some help on Mastodon. This photo has the NIC and the two extra USB slots which are on the back of the case near the bottom</p>
		  
		  <img src="/Images/Club 533C/b0ed8be6adb0fc4f.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
	  <p>Here is more. You can see the RAM sticks and the ribbon cables along with two other PCI slots. The NIC is using one of them.</p>
		  
	 <img src="/Images/Club 533C/b0ed8be6adb0fc4f.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
	  <p>CPU cooler and such.</p>
		  
		 <img src="/Images/Club 533C/26273099440b1f52.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>
	  <p>The PATA hard disk. A day after I got this PC I ran into a weird problem where one of the lights on the optical disk drives and the light for hard disk activity were blinking whenever I turned the PC on. There was a faint clicking sound too but it seems that replugging the PATA hard disk's cable back in solved that problem. It seems that shipping makes cables fall out.</p>

	  <p>All of the inside.</p>
