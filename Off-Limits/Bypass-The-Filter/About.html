            <h2>About Bypass the Filter</h2>

            <p><i>"Now Spotify is blocked?! They say we can listen to music yet they block Spotify, Soundcloud, Bandcamp and all! What is the point of this? They can't just say kids with the headphone pass can listen to msuic yet block all the sources of music at the same time."</i></p>

			<p>The above is a similar quote to what one of my friends said. Although they only complained about Spotify, I realised there was much more blocked.</p>

<p>Why does this page exist you ask? It exists because of my first blog post in relation to this stuff which can be found <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/personalprojects/BLOG/School-Wifi.html">here</a>.
	
			<p>As a summary of what that blog post is, I delved into the challenges faced by high school students when navigating blocked websites within my school's filtering system. I shared the backstory of the filtering system's implementation, which aimed to enhance online safety but inadvertently hindered access to valuable educational resources.</p>

<p>The post shed light on the issue of over-blocking, where legitimate websites were mistakenly categorised and blocked, including harmless sites like the iPhone Wiki. Furthermore, I raised concerns about potential privacy intrusions through the Cyberhound platform's tracking capabilities, emphasising the need for more transparency and consideration of students' online privacy.</p>

<p>To provide evidence, I conducted a survey and tested my own bookmarks to analyse the prevalence of blocked websites. The results revealed that some blocked sites were not harmful, calling for a more thoughtful approach to website categorisation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the blog post advocates for a balanced approach to website filtering, encouraging schools to reevaluate their blocking criteria and engage in open dialogue with students to create a more inclusive and responsible online environment. The ultimate goal is to empower students to embrace digital freedom while ensuring responsible internet use within the school's parameters.</p>
