    <h1 class="crt site-title">About Me</h1>

    <div class="content-box about-me">
    <h2 class="title">Who am I?</h2>
    <h3>Online Identity</h3>
    <p>Online, I am known as Sinclair-Speccy, a combination of the ZX Spectrum and the popular nickname for the ZX Spectrum. People also use Speccy, Sinclair, Altair and Alphonse online for me. I prefer the small web compared to the much larger web with big corps following us.</p>
    <h3>Offline Identity</h3>
    <p>If we drift away from the internet, my real name, last name, country, and other personal information aren't important to post here.</p>
    <h3>Contributions to the Internet</h3>
    <p>I also contribute to several places on the internet such as the <a href="https://archive.org/details/@tasha04342">Internet Archive</a> and the Plazma Burst 2 Discord server (I used to be a mod here). Sometimes I wish I could be more useful to the internet besides be a mod or whatever.</p>
    <h3>Emulation</h3>
    <p>In my spare time when I am in the mode emulators like 86box, VirtualBox, Bochs, and QEMU to explore and relive older OSes of yesteryears. This began when I first got Yggdrasil Linux from the 90s to work.</p>
<h3>A Wishing Tech Journalist</h3>
    <p>One of my dreams is to expand this website to include a tech journalism section. I believe I could contribute insightful articles in a similar vein to sites like 9to5Mac. While I acknowledge that there are already numerous tech journalism outlets on the web, I aspire to bring my unique perspective and voice to the field if the opportunity arises. The only thing truly stopping me is motivation, and the fact this is technically a static website.</p>
		<h3>Artistic stuff</h3>
    <p>Another thing I do in my spare time is take picturs with my camera of my transfrsomer figures to make 3D renders in Bryce 3D, which I am still slowly improving on. You can find this stuff on my Devintart account.</p>
    <h3>Contact Me</h3>
        <p>I am on many places on the internet, but here are a few if you want to friend me:</p>

I do not like the state the current web is in and you only add to it, let alone I do not like capitalism as it was not made for neurodivergent people.</p>

    <div class="content-box interests">
        <h2 class="title">My Interests</h2>
        <p>I have a penchant for vintage technology like mainframes (IBM 704, CDC 6500, Whirlwind I, etc.) and microcomputers (Mark-8, MK14, etc.). In terms of hardware and setup, my main computer is a Windows 10 Lenovo machine. Not the most powerful machine, but it gets the job done.</p>

    <div class="content-box about-website">
        <h2 class="title">About This Website</h2>
        <p>This site was originally just going to be a place for me to share the files I have on my external hard drive, which has 757GB of stuff that are mostly ISO files I have collected from various sources over the past few years. However, from experimenting a lot with vintage Linux distros in my spare time, I decided this site should have more than my files (that can't even be uploaded yet as this site isn't self-hosted), so I thought let's make guides at first, then a friend agreed with the idea of making reviews, so here we are now. Technology will always have a place in my heart, especially vintage technology even if I wasn't born in the time they came out. You can look at some of my personal projects <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/Personal-Projects.html" title="Personal projects">here</a>.</p>
		<p>The above are personal projects. I have two others, one being for <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/Server-Rack/index.html">tech stuff</a> and <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/The-Writers-Desk/index.html" title="Personal projects">writing.</a></p>
        <p>The design of this site began as some simple HTML code since I was new to it again despite learning it in 2018, and the redesign started in June 2022 to make the guides and reviews look neat and tidy.</p>

<div class="content-box Support">
        <h2 class="title">How can I support you?</h2>
        <p>I don't really need support at this time.</p>
