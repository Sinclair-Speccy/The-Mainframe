  <h1 class="title">About me</h1>
      <p>Who am I? Online I am known as Sinclair-Speccy, a combination of the ZX Spectrum and the popular nickname for the ZX Spectrum. People also use Speccy, Sinclair  and Alphonse online for me.</p>
		
	  <p>If we drift away from the internet my name is Tasha. My last name, country and other personal information aren't important to post here.</p>
		
	  <p>I have a penchant for vintage technology like mainframes (IBM 704, CDC 6500, Whirlwind I, etc) and microcomputers (Mark-8, MK14, etc). In terms of hardware and setup I own, my main computer is a Windows 10 Lenovo machine. Not the most powerful machine but it gets the job done.</p>

      <p>This site was originally just going to be a place for me to share the files I have on my external hard drive which has 757GB of stuff that are mostly iso files I have collected from various sources over the past few years but it turns out I can't do that. However, from experimenting a lot with vintage Linux distros in my spare time I decided this site should have more than my files (that can't even be uploaded yet as this site isn't self-hosted) so I thought let's make guides at first, then a friend agreed with the idea of making reviews so here we are now. Technology will always have a place in my heart, especially vintage technology even if I wasn't born in the time they came out. You can look at some of my personal projects <a href="https://sinclair-speccy.github.io/The-Mainframe/projects.html" title="Personal projects">here</a>.</p>
	
      <p>The design of this site began as some simple HTML code since I was new to it again despite learning it in 2018 and the redesign started in June 2022 to make the guides and reviews look neat and tidy.</p>
	
      <p>I also contribute to several places on such as the <a href="https://archive.org/details/@tasha04342">Internet Archive</a>, <a href="https://os-tans.moe/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=61&sid=47b134782257ef7f30deba158a28626d">
OS-tans.moe</a> (I'm a mod here) and the <a href="https://gunkies.org/wiki/User:Sinclair-Speccy">Computer History Wiki</a></p>
