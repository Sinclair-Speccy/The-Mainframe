          <h1 class="title">Arthur review: The less cooler RISC OS?</h1>
          <p>
            A little while ago in 2021, I was talking to a friend about RISC OS
            when I came across "Arthur" because I was doing research
            simultaneously. I thought it was just another OS but it turns out
            Arthur was before RISC OS but RISC OS is the simple rename for
            version 2. The numbering scheme for it is a bit weird but the first
            public release of the OS was Arthur 1.20 in June 1987 but there are
            also 0.30 and 0.20. The OS was developed using a prototype ARM-based
            system connected to a BBC computer, before moving on to the
            prototype Acorn Archimedes the A500. Arthur was not a multitasking
            operating system either.
          </p>

          <p>
            I remembered about it years later and tried to see if there were any
            pages about Arthur but all I really find are videos and no reviews.
            Most reviews are for RISC OS only so I thought let’s do one for
            Arthur then, so let's look at it again. If you wish to try Arthur
            out yourself without downloading an emulator you can try it in a web
            browser
            <a

          />

              type="video/mp4"
            />
            Your browser does not support the video tag.

          <p>
            My emulator of choice for getting Arthur OS to run is Arculator as
            it already has Arthur for you when you make a machine. Arthur seems
            to boot up pretty fast regardless of what I make the settings for
            the emulated computer. This is emulating the Archimedes 305 and this
            is using Arthur 0.30.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Arthur desktop.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur Desktop Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            As you can see when it is done booting you get a desktop with a dark
            blue background and a “taskbar” that is light blue with white icons
            on the bottom. As for the icons on the left is a floppy disk icon,
            and on the right are 5 other icons for a palette, notepad, a diary,
            a clock, a calculator, and the exit icon. You may notice the icons
            are different sizes too.
          </p>

          <video class="responsive" controls>
            <source
              src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Drive error message.mp4"
              type="video/mp4"
            />
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
          </video>

          <p>
            Since there’s no floppy disk in the drive clicking on the floppy
            icon does nothing and only gives an error saying the system reported
            an error because the drive is empty. It seems once you get the error
            you can’t move the cursor which is dark blue with a light blue
            outline out of the borders for the message box, which is odd.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Palette.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur Palette Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            Open windows have a beige coloured bar at the top and for buttons
            was well. There’s a palette thing in Arthur which allows you to load
            and save palettes.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Palette 2.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur Palette 2 Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            You can also change the colours of the palette so if I change the
            dark blue to purple, it changes the background. The same goes for
            the light blue for the taskbar so now I can have a light green
            taskbar with a lilac background, a dark pink colour for the button
            colours, yellow for the text colours and a different coloured floppy
            icon. This reminds me of Windows 1.0
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Palette icon.PNG"
            alt="Arthur Palette Icon Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            Changing the palette also changes the colours on the icon for the
            palette as the icon is designed to look like a palette board!
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Notepad.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur Notepad Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            The notepad is interesting. You can type in it but you can’t use
            backspace to remove words or to remove a space as you can tell in
            the screenshot. Not sure if this is an emulator thing or an actual
            thing with Arthur. Some of it turned pink as it is an active window
            with a different palette.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Notepad full screen.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur Notepad Full Screen Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            You can make it full screen by clicking on the icon at the top right
            of the window. Exiting the notepad seems to keep your changes for
            when you open the notepad again if you haven’t turned the machine
            off.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Diary.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur Diary Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            Arthur has a built-in diary that has the wrong year as it is 2023
            and not 0000. Arthur existed when the universe began /s.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Diary 2.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur Diary 2 Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            Clicking on a date opens another window that takes note of the day
            you click on along with the month and year but that seems to be
            about it. it only lets you pick one.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Clock.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur Clock Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            There’s also a clock which shows analogue and digital time under as
            24 hour time in which I cannot read well. The analogue clock only
            has the hour, minute and second hands on it.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Calculator.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur Calculator Screenshot"
          />

          <p>The calculator is a simple calculator which works.</p>

              src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Calculator 2.mp4"

          <p>
            As you can tell I suck at using calculators on a PC where you have
            to manually do it. Physical ones are better sometimes.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Drive error message 2.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur Drive Error Message 2 Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            I put in a LILO boot disk to see how Arthur would react and it seems
            it reports “error 10” at :0/00000000 which to me indicates it at
            least detected *something* in the drive but can’t open it.
            Attempting to make a blank disk and trying to load it doesn’t do
            much either as you get the same error.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Exit.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur Exit Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            Exiting the machine results in this screen for which shows how long
            your session went on.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/Arthur 1.20.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur 1.20 Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            Arthur 1.20 isn’t much different besides changing the taskbar colour
            to a beige colour and the icons are better sized to be equal.
          </p>

          <img
            src="../Images/Images-for-pages/Reviews/Arthur/ARM BBC BASIC V.PNG"
            class="responsive"
            alt="Arthur ARM BBC BASIC V Screenshot"
          />

          <p>
            Arculator has the option to run Arthur 1.20 on a A500 prototype but
            you won’t get much besides be redirected to ARM BBC BASIC V.
