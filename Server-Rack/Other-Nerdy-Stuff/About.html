            <p>It's here! MARCHintosh 2024 is in full swing and I never thought I would partake in it again. Last year I focused on the Twiggy Mac and Sony Test pre-release version of System 1 which seemed different to what others were doing at the time. It got me a decent amount of people enjoying the post so why not do it again?</p>
            <p>However at first I was debating it. What was I supposed to do? If I was to do it again this year, I want to try something different like I did last year. The different thing? Looking at Mac malware?</p>
            <p>But why Mac malware? Personally I believe that despite malware being “bad”, older malware did interesting stuff as nowadays all the malware is just crypto scams. nVIR with humor in its message, expressing dissatisfaction with Apple and the then-state of computer viruses, HyperCard viruses with HyperCard Stacks and HC which on German language versions of the operating system it would play German folk tunes and display messages such as “Hey, what are you doing?” and “Don’t panic”.</p>
            <p>You don’t really hear much about Mac viruses because everyone acts like they’re invincible to malware, when this just isn’t true.</p>
            <p>I came across the current theme you see now and thought it would be the perfect theme for this year. The HTML and CSS is made by Al Such which can be found <a href="https://ajaxironside.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>. It is an open-source, retro-style web theme using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and uses iFrames to display content in this "Main Window" section of the page. You might need to open the link in a new tab as since this uses iframes, it will open in this current window.</p>
            <p>To navigate, use the menu bar at the top to pick a virus to read about it! They will have dropdowns so yeah.</p>
