        <p><i>Sinclair-Speccy: "Oh hey it's the 1st of
        March"</i></p>
        <p><i>My friend: "Nice! Looking forward to Marchintosh?
        ðŸ‘€"</i></p>
        <p>In hindsight, no, I was not looking forward to it. I had
        no actual Apple computer running macOS or a classic Mac
        anywhere in my house to even partake for MARCHintosh.</p>

      <article>
        <h1 class="title">What is MARCHintosh?</h1>
        <p>As an extract from the official <a href=
        "https://www.marchintosh.com/">MARCHintosh</a> site:</p>
        <p><i>With the success of such events as DOScember and
        SEPTandy, why shouldn't the Macintosh retrocomputing
        community have their own month to share their passion for
        classic Macintosh computers? MARCHintosh has been an
        exciting online event since its creation in 2021. We're
        excited to continue this tradition in 2023!</i></p>
        <p><i>And that's where you come in...</i></p>
        <p><i>We're asking that content creators from all
        communities and platforms - even folks who don't normally
        produce Macintosh retrocomputing content - work together to
        help spread the word about #MARCHintosh - a month-long
        event starting on Wednesday, March 1st, 2023.</i></p>
        <p>I had no plans to partake in MARCHintosh at all until on
        the 7th of March I remembered the Twiggy Mac prototype
        existed and could be emulated...</p>

        <h1 class="title">The Twiggy Mac and Sony Test pre-release
        version of System 1</h1>
        <p>Trying to emulate this stuff isn't too hard. You can
        grab the files for emulation from <a href=
        "http://toastytech.com/guis/twiggy.html">Toasty
        Tech</a>.</p><img src="Images/MARCHintosh/Sony%20Test.png"
        class="responsive" alt="Sony Test version">
        <p>This is the Sony Test version. I didn't get many
        screenshots of this as it was not very
        interesting.</p><img src=
        "Images/MARCHintosh/Twiggy%20Paint.png" class="responsive"

        <p>Mac Paint that came with the Twiggy Mac
        stuff.</p><img src="Images/MARCHintosh/Cat.png" class=
        "responsive" alt="Cat image on Twiggy Mac">
        <p>I wonder what the context of the cat person is
        for.</p><img src="Images/MARCHintosh/Paint%20Crash.png"

        <p>Trying to exit it would crash the Mac, lol.</p><img src=

        <p>More screenshots for #MARCHintosh of the Twiggy Mac
        :)</p><img src=

        "Images/MARCHintosh/Journal.png" class="responsive" alt=
        "Journal on Twiggy Mac">
        <p>There seems to be a thing called "journal" but I am
        unsure on what it does. It has "Record", "Play" and "Stop"
        along with "Exit" but trying to click any of them seems to
        crash the machine.</p>
        <p>Why is not not a review post? Not really worth a review
        noting that I have so few screenshots plus Toasty Tech has
        a better review of both the Sony Test and Twiggy Mac.</p>
