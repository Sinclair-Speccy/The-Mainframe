            <h2 align='center'>Trying Zuc</h2>
		  <p>Getting Zuc to work was way much easier than my attempt are trying to get Scores to work. It came on a very obvious infected program.</p>

        <p>The icon is of the infected program...</p>
			
				<img src="Zuc/Zuc-icon.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>

        <p>Using ResEdit we can see it has an init in its code :P</p>
			
			<img src="Zuc/CODEs.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>

        <p>And the icon is labeled "Blesser icon"</p>
			
						<img src="Zuc/Blesser.png" alt=""/>

        <p>This is the main screen for the infected program that has ZUC on it. A quick search does me give the exact same thing at the Macintosh Repository for this exact program..</p>

        <p>Not much interesting stuff when looking at the extra info on it</p>	
							<img src="Zuc/info.png" class="responsive"/>

        <p>Running the file brings up this. Clicking cancel closes the program so you don't actually see what is behind the option to pick a folder</p>

			<p>After opening the file and clicking around a little bit, we can assume that the infection has begun since we ran the infected program.</p>
			<p>After waiting a few minutes, one of Zuc's payloads which is to make the mouse move diagonally when the mosue buttons are clicked are already starting to show.</p>
