            <h2 align='center'>Trying Zuc</h2>
		  <p>Getting Zuc to work was way much easier than my attempt are trying to get Scores to work. It came on a very obvious infected program.</p>

        <p>The icon is of the infected program...</p>
			
				<img src="Zuc/Zuc-icon.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>

        <p>Using ResEdit we can see it has an init in its code :P</p>
			
			<img src="Zuc/CODEs.png" alt="" class="responsive"/>

        <p>And the icon is labeled "Blesser icon"</p>
			
						<img src="Zuc/Blesser.png" alt=""/>

        <p>This is the main screen for the infected program that has ZUC on it. A quick search does me give the exact same thing at the Macintosh Repository for this exact program..</p>

        <p>Not much interesting stuff when looking at the extra info on it</p>

        <p>Running the file brings up this. Clicking cancel closes the program so you don't actually see what is behind the option to pick a folder</p>

			<p>After opening the file and clicking around a little bit, we can assume that the infection has begun since we ran the infected program.</p>
			<p>After waiting a few minutes, one of Zuc's payloads which is to make the mouse move diagonally when the mosue buttons are clicked are already starting to show.</p>

			<p>In fact you can't actually do anything most of the time as your cursor keeps running away. Like you see right now, it is hard to even open the hard disk.</p>
			
			<p>The cursor even bounces if you hold down one of the mouse buttons so it is like the DVD video logo bouncing.</p>

			<p>Although not really a cause of the Zuc virus, the largest unused block goes all funny too. I was told this must be a quirk of how the Macâ€™s memory manager works</p>

			<p>Since I am emulating a Mac this may be different on a real machine but restarting the machine makes all of the weird stuff stop.</p>
			
			<p>The scanning starts now :P</p>
			
						<img src="Zuc/Scanning.png" class="responsive"/>
			
			<p>And we have the virus detected along with some unrelated errors.</p>
			
									<img src="Zuc/Detected.png" class="responsive"/>
			
			<p>Before you know it the cursor moving away diagonally happened once again as soon as this scan finishes XD.</p>
			
			<p>I guess we can say goodbye to ZUC A as I disinfect the hard disk which in itself was hard because of the moving cursor :')</p>
