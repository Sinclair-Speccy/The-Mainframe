# Emulation Software

Emulation software plays a significant role in the world of technology by bridging the gap between past and present computing experiences. It serves as a powerful tool for recreating and preserving digital history.

## The History of Emulation

Emulation has a history dating back to the early days of computing. It emerged as a solution to the challenge of running software designed for one hardware architecture on a different architecture. The need for emulation became evident as computer systems evolved, and older hardware and software became obsolete.

Early emulators were primarily developed to maintain compatibility with legacy software and hardware, allowing businesses and individuals to continue using essential applications as technology advanced. Over time, emulation expanded its scope to include not only hardware but also entire operating systems and software ecosystems.

## Types of Emulation

Emulation encompasses various forms, each designed for specific purposes. The primary type is **Hardware Emulation**, which replicates the behaviour of hardware components, such as CPUs, GPUs, or peripheral devices. This allows the execution of software designed for a specific hardware platform on different hardware.

# Digital Preservation and Combating Obsolescence

Emulation is a crucial strategy in the pursuit of digital preservation. It helps safeguard software, hardware, and digital content from becoming obsolete and inaccessible. Here's how emulation contributes to these goals:

- **Access to Legacy Software**: Emulation ensures that older software, designed for outdated hardware and operating systems, remains accessible and usable.

- **Preventing Data Loss**: Emulation helps prevent data loss by allowing access to files and formats that may have become obsolete, ensuring the longevity of digital archives and libraries.

- **Preserving Cultural and Historical Artifacts**: Emulation is preserving cultural and historical artifacts, including video games, software, and interactive media, for future generations.

# Software for Different OSes and Hardware

Emulators exist for various hardware and operating systems, providing a wide range of options. While this section covers the basics, there are many more emulators available. Feel free to contribute more suggestions. This page only covers the basics as trying to make a category for which emulator goes into which can be tricky.

# Hardware Emulation

Hardware emulation replicates the behaviour of physical hardware components using software. It enables you to run software designed for one hardware architecture on a different architecture, making it a valuable tool for various purposes, including testing, development, and digital preservation.

# Emulated Hardware Components

Hardware emulation encompasses a wide range of components, including:

- **Central Processing Units (CPUs)**: Emulation of CPUs allows you to run software written for specific CPU architectures on different CPUs.

- **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)**: GPU emulation is essential for running applications that rely on GPU-specific features.

- **Peripheral Devices**: Emulating peripheral devices like printers, network cards, and sound cards ensures compatibility with older software.

## Popular computer system emulators

Some popular hardware emulators includes:

1. **QEMU**: A versatile and open-source emulator that supports multiple hardware architectures including x86, ARM, and more.

2. **Bochs**: An open-source emulator designed primarily for x86-based systems.

3. **DOSBox**: A DOS emulator that allows you to run classic DOS applications and games on modern systems.

4. **86box**: Goes beyond DOS emulation by emulating early versions of Windows and vintage PC hardware.

5. **SheepShaver**: Specializes in emulating PowerPC-based Macintosh hardware, enabling you to run older Mac OS environments on modern systems.

6. **Basilisk II**: Focuses on emulating early Mac OS versions, including System 7 and early Mac OS 8.

These are more well-known emulators however there are a lot more on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_system_emulators). Trying to list every single emulator here would take too long.
