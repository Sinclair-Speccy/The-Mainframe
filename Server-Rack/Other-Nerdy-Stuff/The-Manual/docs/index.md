# Welcome to The Emulation Manual

So... welcome to the cooler replacement for the guides section on my website under the "Server Rack" page. While this manual primarily focuses on emulation, it will also cover a variety of other topics to provide you with other information (I hope).

## About This Manual

So after emulating for a while now I decied to put together this manual for fun. It is more of intended to be a thing I can refer to at times but other people can use it too.

## Contents

This manual covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Types of emulation software
- How to emulate different operating systems and hardware
- Troubleshooting
- Resources
- Future developments
- Notes and tips

## Get Started

To get started with this manual, explore the sections in the navigation bar above. I  hope you find the information here useful.

This manual is also in its beta stages so don't expect to see much for now.
