        <h1 class="title">The Packard Bell Club 533C</h1>
        <p>Well well well, wasn't this a deal? I saw this PC listed on ebay for like $90. It was a bid so I bidded the
          $90 and waited to see if I got it and to my excitement I did get it! Since the listing had postage too it
          added up to $110 but that isn't too bad compared to the prices I see computers listed here for as they're all
          so expensive!</p>

        <h2 class="title">History</h2>
        <p>The history? Well, originally I was trying to install Windows 98SE on the old family PC on a separate hard
          drive but nothing would work as it only had 1GB of RAM and Windows 98 and 98SE hate having 1GB for some
          reason. After a lot of trial and error I kinda gave up in dismay and well, waited to see if I could find a
          cheap retro PC. A lot of the PCs I found were too expensive and either the buyer wanted so much more for
          postage or wouldn't post at all until one day I saw the Club 355C listed on ebay for a cheap price so I
          launched into it and bidded on it. To my excitement no one else bidded on it and I won the bid! It arrived way
          earlier than expected too but that was a bonus.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Specifications</h2>
        <p>As for the specifications, I can list them properly for this machine hahaha! This PC has:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Celeron clocked at 2.66Ghz</li>
          <li>768Mb RAM with 32MB integrated</li>
          <li>A 18.6GB PATA hard disk</li>
          <li>A RTL8139 network interface card (to be exact it's a Realtek RTL8139/810X Family PCI Fast Ethernet NIC)
          </li>
          <li>Two optical disk drives, one being a 52x CD-ROM and the other being a 52x CD burner</li>
          <li>A 1.44MB floppy disk drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The PC originally came with no OS so I installed Windows 98SE along with the unofficial Windows 98 Second
          Edition Service Pack 3.</p>

            on the optical disk drives and the light for hard disk activity were blinking whenever I turned the PC on.
            There was a faint clicking sound too but it seems that replugging the PATA hard disk's cable back in solved
            that problem. It seems that shipping makes cables fall out.</figcaption>
