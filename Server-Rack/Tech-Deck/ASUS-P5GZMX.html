        <p>The family PC! This desktop has been around since I was
        a little kid, and it was my first introduction to
        computers. At the time in the wonderful years of the 2000s
        and 2010s, it ran XP.</p>

        <p>It has 1GB of RAM which was a bit large for XP at the
        time, smells horribly of cigarettes as my dad is a smoker,
        two CD-ROM drives that are jammed, and a 465GB hard disk. I
        attempted to upgrade the RAM but got the wrong type of RAM
        as it uses DDR2 SDRAM and not DDR3 or whatever it was that
        I had purchased. As for the form factor of the motherboard
        the PC uses, it is a microATX. The PC also has a Pentium
        CPU which I believe is a Core 2 Duo (the same as my iMac,
        heh). The maximum RAM the PC can have is 2GB... there is
        not much to say about this PC.</p>
        <p>The PC originally ran Windows XP with service pack 1 but
        was upgraded to XP with service pack 3.</p>

            Good ol Windows Messenger with the .NET messenger
            service. Sounds like something from a long time ago
            doesn't it? Like when .Mac used to be around. If you
            think the images are cropped they are not. These were
            taken on my phone.
