      <h1 class="title">The ASUS P5GZ-MX</h1>
      <p>The family PC! This desktop has been around since I was a little kid, and it was my first introduction to computers. At the time in the wonderful years of the 2000s and 2010s, it ran XP. </p>

      <h2 class="title">Specifications</h2>
		  <p>It has 1GB of RAM which was a bit large for XP at the time, smells horribly of cigarettes as my dad is a smoker, two CD-ROM drives that are jammed, and a 465GB hard disk. I attempted to upgrade the RAM but got the wrong type of RAM as it uses DDR2 SDRAM and not DDR3 or whatever it was that I had purchased. As for the form factor of the motherboard the PC uses, it is a microATX. The PC also has a Pentium CPU which I believe is a Core 2 Duo (the same as my iMac, heh). The maximum RAM the PC can have is 2GB.... there is not much to say about this PC.</p>
		  
		  <p>The PC originally ran Windows XP with service pack 1 but was upgraded to XP with service pack 3.</p>

		  <p>Loading the desktop. There are no speakers so you can't hear the startup sound.</p>

		  <p>Good ol Windows Messenger with the .NET messenger service. Sounds like something from a long time ago doesn't it? Like when .Mac used to be around. If you think the images are cropped they are not. These were taken on my phone.</p>

		  <p>It still has Flash installed despite Flash being dead now. Thanks Steve Jobs for killing Flash.</p>

		  <p>Imagine paying for Winrar. I assume everyone tried to avoid that when possible, like paying for Adobe products!</p>

	  <p>Solitaire! Did you know pressing Alt + Shift + 2 during game play would give you a instant win?</p>
